TI  - Survey of Wireless Indoor Positioning Techniques and Systems
DO  - 10.1109/TSMCC.2007.905750
PY  - 2007///
AB  - Wireless indoor positioning systems have become very popular in recent years. These systems have been successfully used in many applications such as asset tracking and inventory management. This paper provides an overview of the existing wireless indoor positioning solutions and attempts to classify different techniques and systems. Three typical location estimation schemes of triangulation, scene analysis, and proximity are analyzed. We also discuss location fingerprinting in detail since it is used in most current system or solutions. We then examine a set of properties by which location systems are evaluated, and apply this evaluation method to survey a number of existing systems. Comprehensive performance comparisons including accuracy, precision, complexity, scalability, robustness, and cost are presented.

TI  - The Toyota way : 14 management principles from the world's greatest manufacturer
PY  - 2004///
AB  - 'This book will give you an understanding of what has made Toyota successful and some practical ideas that you can use to develop your own approach to business' - Gary Convis, Managing Office of Toyota. Fewer man-hours. Less inventory. The highest quality cars with the fewest defects of any competing manufacturer. In factories around the globe, Toyota consistently raises the bar for manufacturing, product development, and process excellence. The result is an amazing business success story: steadily taking market share from price-cutting competitors, earning far more profit than any other automaker, and winning the praise of business leaders worldwide."The Toyota Way" reveals the management principles behind Toyota's worldwide reputation for quality and reliability. Dr. Jeffrey Liker, a renowned authority on Toyota's Lean methods, explains how you can adopt these principles - known as the 'Toyota Production System' or 'Lean Production' - to improve the speed of your business processes, improve product and service quality, and cut costs, no matter what your industry.Drawing on his extensive research on Toyota, Dr.Liker shares his insights into the foundational principles at work in the Toyota culture. He explains how the Toyota Production System evolved as a new paradigm of manufacturing excellence, transforming businesses across industries. You'll learn how Toyota fosters employee involvement at all levels, discover the difference between traditional process improvement and Toyota's Lean improvement, and learn why companies often think they are Lean-but aren't. The fourteen management principles of the "Toyota Way" create the ideal environment for implementing Lean techniques and tools.Dr. Liker explains each key principle with detailed, examples from Toyota and other Lean companies on how to: foster an atmosphere of continuous improvement and learning; create continuous process 'flow' to unearth problems; satisfy customers (and eliminate waste at the same time); grow your leaders rather than purchase them; get quality right the first time; and grow together with your suppliers and partners for mutual benefit.Dr.Liker shows the Toyota Way in action, then outlines how to apply the "Toyota Way" in your organization, with examples of how other companies have rebuilt their culture to create a Lean, learning enterprise. "The Toyota Way" is an inspiring guide to taking the steps necessary to emulate Toyota's remarkable success. What can your business learn from Toyota? How to double or triple the speed of any business process? How to build quality into workplace systems? How to eliminate the huge costs of hidden waste? How to turn every employee into a quality control inspector? How to dramatically improve your products and services! With a market capitalization greater than the value of General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler combined, Toyota is also, (by far), the world's most profitable automaker.Toyota's secret weapon is Lean production - the revolutionary approach to business processes that it invented in the 1950's and has spent decades perfecting. Today businesses around the world are implementing Toyota's radical system for speeding up processes, reducing waste, and improving quality. "The Toyota Way", explains Toyota's unique approach to lean - the 14 management principles and philosophy that drive Toyota's quality and efficiency-obsessed culture. You'll gain valuable insights that can be applied to any organization and any business process, whether in services or manufacturing.Professor Jeffrey Liker has been studying Toyota for twenty years, and was given unprecedented access to Toyota executives, employees and factories, both in Japan and the United States, for this landmark work. The book is full of examples of the 14 fundamental principles at work in the Toyota culture, and how these principles create a culture of continuous learning and improvement. You'll discover how the right combination of long-term philosophy, process, people, and problem solving can transform your organization into a Lean, learning enterprise - the Toyota Way.

TI  - Does Management Matter? Evidence from India
DO  - 10.1596/1813-9450-5573
PY  - 2011///
AB  - A long-standing question in social science is to what extent differences in management cause differences in firm performance. To investigate this, the authors ran a management field experiment on large Indian textile firms, providing free consulting on modern management practices to a randomly chosen set of treatment plants and compared their performance to the control plants. They find that adopting these management practices had three main effects. First, it raised average productivity by 11 percent through improved quality and efficiency and reduced inventory. Second, it increased decentralization of decision making, as better information flow enabled owners to delegate more decisions to middle managers. Third, it increased the use of computers, necessitated by the data collection and analysis involved in modern management. Since these practices were profitable this raises the question of why firms had not adopted these before. Their results suggest that informational barriers were a primary factor in explaining this lack of adoption. Modern management is a technology that diffuses slowly between firms, with many Indian firms initially unaware of its existence or impact. Since competition was limited by constraints on firm entry and growth, badly managed firms were not rapidly driven from the market.

TI  - Earnings Management Through Real Activities Manipulation
DO  - 10.2139/ssrn.477941
PY  - 2003///
AB  - I find evidence consistent with managers manipulating real activities to avoid reporting annual losses: price discounts to temporarily increase sales, overproduction to report lower cost of goods sold, and reduction of discretionary expenditures to improve reported margins among firms reporting small annual profits. Cross-sectional analysis reveals that these activities are less prevalent in the presence of sophisticated investors, suggesting that the activities do not contribute to long-run value. Other factors that influence the extent of real activities manipulation include industry membership, the stock of inventories and receivables, and finally, incentives to meet zero earnings, including the presence of debt and growth opportunities. There is also some, though less robust, evidence of real activities manipulation to meet annual analyst forecasts.

AB  - Over the past decade, a number of researchers have extended conventional models of business fixed investment to incorporate a role for financial constraints' in determining investment. This paper reviews developments and challenges in this empirical research, and uses advances in models of information and incentive problems to motivate those developments and challenges. First, I describe analytical underpinnings of models of capital-market imperfections in the investment process, and illustrate the principal testable implications of those models. Second, I motivate tests and describe and critique existing empirical studies. Third, the review considers applications of the underlying models to a range of investment activities, including inventory investment, R&D, employment demand, pricing by imperfectly competitive firms, business formation and survival, and risk management. Fourth, I discuss implications of this research program for analysis of effects of investment on monetary policy and tax policy. Finally, I examine some potentially fruitful avenues for future research.

DO  - 10.1111/1540-8520.t01-1-00013
PY  - 2003///
AB  - The appropriate resources are necessary but insufficient to achieve a competitive advantage. Resources must also be managed effectively. Herein, we develop a resource management process model composed of three components that can lead to a competitive advantage. These components include the resource inventory (evaluating, adding, and shedding), resource bundling, and resource leveraging. We examine resource management in family firms and thus explore the unique characteristics of five resources and attributes of family firms that provide potential advantages over nonfamily firms. The resources are human capital, social capital, patient capital, survivability capital, along with the governance structure attribute.

TI  - Information distortion in a supply chain: the bullwhip effect
DO  - 10.1287/MNSC.43.4.546
PY  - 1997///
AB  - (This article originally appeared in Management Science, April 1997, Volume 43, Number 4, pp. 546-558, published by The Institute of Management Sciences.) Consider a series of companies in a supply chain, each of whom orders from its immediate upstream member. In this setting, inbound orders from a downstream member serve as a valuable informational input to upstream production and inventory decisions. This paper claims that the information transferred in the form of "orders" tends to be distorted and can misguide upstream members in their inventory and production decisions. In particular, the variance of orders may be larger than that of sales, and distortion tends to increase as one moves upstream-a phenomenon termed "bullwhip effect." This paper analyzes four sources of the bullwhip effect: demand signal processing, rationing game, order batching, and price variations. Actions that can be taken to mitigate the detrimental impact of this distortion are also discussed.

TI  - Refining the relationship between personality and subjective well-being.
DO  - 10.1037/0033-2909.134.1.138
PY  - 2008///
AB  - Understanding subjective well-being (SWB) has historically been a core human endeavor and presently spans fields from management to mental health. Previous meta-analyses have indicated that personality traits are one of the best predictors. Still, these past results indicate only a moderate relationship, weaker than suggested by several lines of reasoning. This may be because of commensurability, where researchers have grouped together substantively disparate measures in their analyses. In this article, the authors review and address this problem directly, focusing on individual measures of personality (e.g., the Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness Personality Inventory; P. T. Costa & R. R. McCrae, 1992) and categories of SWB (e.g., life satisfaction). In addition, the authors take a multivariate approach, assessing how much variance personality traits account for individually as well as together. Results indicate that different personality and SWB scales can be substantively different and that the relationship between the two is typically much larger (e.g., 4 times) than previous meta-analyses have indicated. Total SWB variance accounted for by personality can reach as high as 39% or 63% disattenuated. These results also speak to meta-analyses in general and the need to account for scale differences once a sufficient research base has been generated.

TI  - Transforming the Balanced Scorecard from Performance Measurement to Strategic Management: Part II
DO  - 10.2308/ACCH.2001.15.1.87
PY  - 2001///
AB  - Several years ago we introduced the Balanced Scorecard (Kaplan and Norton 1992). We began with the premise that an exclusive reliance on financial measures in a management system is insufficient. Financial measures are lag indicators that report on the outcomes from past actions. Exclusive reliance on financial indicators could promote behavior that sacrifices long-term value creation for short-term performance (Porter 1992; AICPA 1994). The Balanced Scorecard approach retains measures of financial performance--the lagging outcome indicators--but supplements these with measures on the drivers, the lead indicators, of future financial performance. THE BALANCED SCORECARD EMERGES The limitations of managing solely with financial measures, however, have been known for decades. [1] What is different now? Why has the Balanced Scorecard concept been so widely adopted by manufacturing and service companies, nonprofit organizations, and government entities around the world since its introduction in 1992? First, previous systems that incorporated nonfinancial measurements used ad hoc collections of such measures, more like checklists of measures for managers to keep track of and improve than a comprehensive system of linked measurements. The Balanced Scorecard emphasizes the linkage of measurement to strategy (Kaplan and Norton 1993) and the cause-and-effect linkages that describe the hypotheses of the strategy (Kaplan and Norton 1996b). The tighter connection between the measurement system and strategy elevates the role for nonfinancial measures from an operational checklist to a comprehensive system for strategy implementation (Kaplan and Norton 1996a). Second, the Balanced Scorecard reflects the changing nature of technology and competitive advantage in the latter decades of the 20th century. In the industrial-age competition of the 19th and much of the 20th centuries, companies achieved competitive advantage from their investment in and management of tangible assets such as inventory, property, plant, and equipment (Chandler 1990). In an economy dominated by tangible assets, financial measurements were adequate to record investments on companies' balance sheets. Income statements could also capture the expenses associated with the use of these tangible assets to produce revenues and profits. But by the end of the 20th century, intangible assets became the major source for competitive advantage. In 1982, tangible book values represented 62 percent of industrial organizations' market values; ten years later, the ratio had plummeted to 38 percent (Blair 1995). By the end of the 20th century, the book value of tangible assets accounted for less than 20 percen t of companies' market values (Webber 2000, quoting research by Baruch Lev). Clearly, strategies for creating value shifted from managing tangible assets to knowledge-based strategies that create and deploy an organization's intangible assets. These include customer relationships, innovative products and services, high-quality and responsive operating processes, skills and knowledge of the workforce, the information technology that supports the work force and links the firm to its customers and suppliers, and the organizational climate that encourages innovation, problem-solving, and improvement. But companies were unable to adequately measure their intangible assets (Johnson and Kaplan 1987, 201-202). Anecdotal data from management publications indicated that many companies could not implement their new strategies in this environment (Kiechel 1982; Charan and Colvin 1999). They could not manage what they could not describe or measure. INTANGIBLE ASSETS: VALUATION VS. VALUE CREATION Some call for accountants to make an organization's intangible assets more visible to managers and investors by placing them on a company's balance sheet. But several factors prevent valid valuation of intangible assets on balance sheets. …

TI  - Carbon Footprint and the Management of Supply Chains: Insights From Simple Models
DO  - 10.1109/TASE.2012.2203304
PY  - 2013///
AB  - Using relatively simple and widely used models, we illustrate how carbon emission concerns could be integrated into operational decision-making with regard to procurement, production, and inventory management. We show how, by associating carbon emission parameters with various decision variables, traditional models can be modified to support decision-making that accounts for both cost and carbon footprint. We examine how the values of these parameters as well as the parameters of regulatory emission control policies affect cost and emissions. We use the models to study the extent to which carbon reduction requirements can be addressed by operational adjustments, as an alternative (or a supplement) to costly investments in carbon-reducing technologies. We also use the models to investigate the impact of collaboration among firms within the same supply chain on their costs and carbon emissions and study the incentives firms might have in seeking such cooperation. We provide a series of insights that highlight the impact of operational decisions on carbon emissions and the importance of operational models in evaluating the impact of different regulatory policies and in assessing the benefits of investments in more carbon efficient technologies. Note to Practitioners-Firms worldwide, responding to the threat of government legislation or to concerns raised by their own consumers or shareholders, are undertaking initiatives to reduce their carbon footprint. It is the conventional thinking that such initiatives will require either capital investments or a switch to more expensive sources of energy or input material. In this paper, we show that firms could effectively reduce their carbon emissions without significantly increasing their costs by making only operational adjustments and by collaborating with other members of their supply chain. We describe optimization models that can be used by firms to support operational decision making and supply chain collaboration, while taking into account carbon emissions. We analyze the effect of different emission regulations, including strict emission caps, taxes on emissions, cap-and-offset, and cap-and-trade, on supply chain management decisions. In particular, we show that the presence of emission regulation can significantly increase the value of supply chain collaboration.

Disjoint planning horizons are shown to be possible which eliminate the necessity of having data for the full N periods.

AB  - ABSTRACT We review the Operations Research/Management Science (OR/MS) literature on supply chain disruptions in order to take stock of the research to date and to provide an overview of the research questions that have been addressed. We first place disruptions in the context of other forms of supply uncertainty and discuss common modeling approaches. We then discuss 180 scholarly works on the topic, organized into six categories: evaluating supply disruptions; strategic decisions; sourcing decisions; contracts and incentives; inventory; and facility location. We conclude with a discussion of future research directions.

PY  - 2003///
AB  - The relation between working capital management and corporate profitablity is investigated for a sample of 1,009 large Belgian non-financial firms for the 1992-1996 period. Trade credit policy and inventory policy are measured by number of days accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventories, and the cash conversion cycle is used as a comprehensice measure of working capital management. The results suggest that managers can increase corporate profitablity by reducing the number of days accounts receivable and inventories. Less profitable firms wait longer to pay their bills.

TI  - On the Value of Mitigation and Contingency Strategies for Managing Supply Chain Disruption Risks
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.1060.0515
PY  - 2006///
AB  - We study a single-product setting in which a firm can source from two suppliers, one that is unreliable and another that is reliable but more expensive. Suppliers are capacity constrained, but the reliable supplier may possess volume flexibility. We prove that in the special case in which the reliable supplier has no flexibility and the unreliable supplier has infinite capacity, a risk-neutral firm will pursue a single disruption-management strategy: mitigation by carrying inventory, mitigation by single-sourcing from the reliable supplier, or passive acceptance. We find that a suppliers percentage uptime and the nature of the disruptions (frequent but short versus rare but long) are key determinants of the optimal strategy. For a given percentage uptime, sourcing mitigation is increasingly favored over inventory mitigation as disruptions become less frequent but longer. Further, we show that a mixed mitigation strategy (partial sourcing from the reliable supplier and carrying inventory) can be optimal if the unreliable supplier has finite capacity or if the firm is risk averse. Contingent rerouting is a possible tactic if the reliable supplier can ramp up its processing capacity, that is, if it has volume flexibility. We find that contingent rerouting is often a component of the optimal disruption-management strategy, and that it can significantly reduce the firms costs. For a given percentage uptime, mitigation rather than contingent rerouting tends to be optimal if disruptions are rare.

TI  - Inventory and Quantitative Assessment of Geosites and Geodiversity Sites: a Review
DO  - 10.1007/s12371-014-0139-3
PY  - 2016///
AB  - The inventory and quantitative assessment of the most valuable occurrences of geodiversity are essential steps in any geoconservation strategy and in the establishment of priorities in site management. Despite the existence of many site inventories applied to different scales (countries, municipalities, parks, etc.), the criteria used for their selection are often unclear and poorly defined. This paper proposes a new approach to the concepts of geosite and geodiversity site and reviews the procedures used in the development of a systematic site inventory applied to different scales and values. Procedures to achieve a numerical evaluation of the value and degradation risk of sites are reviewed and new criteria are proposed. Finally, guidelines are presented, bearing in mind the preparation of effective geodiversity inventories, to support geoparks’ strategies. This paper aims to contribute to a better understanding and use of the above-mentioned concepts, which are essential for the implementation of geoconservation actions worldwide.

TI  - A Method for Assessing Hydrologic Alteration within Ecosystems
DO  - 10.1046/J.1523-1739.1996.10041163.X
PY  - 1996///
AB  - Hydrologic regimes play a major role in determining the biotic composition, structure, and function of aquatic, wetland, and riparian ecosystems. But human land and water uses are substantially altering hydrologic regimes around the world. Improved quantitative evaluations of human-induced hydrologic changes are needed to advance research on the biotic implications of hydrologic alteration and to support ecosystem management and restoration plans. We propose a method for assessing the degree of hydrologic alteration attributable to human influence within an ecosystem. This method, referred to as the “Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration,” is based upon an analysis of hydrologic data available either from existing measurement points within an ecosystem (such as at stream gauges or wells) or model-generated data. We use 32 parameters, organized into five groups, to statistically characterize hydrologic variation within each year. These 32 parameters provide information on ecologically significant features of surface and ground water regimes influencing aquatic, wetland, and riparian ecosystems. We then assess the hydrologic perturbations associated with activities such as dam operations, flow diversion, groundwater pumping, or intensive land-use conversion by comparing measures of central tendency and dispersion for each parameter between user-defined “pre-impact” and “post-impact” time frames, generating 64 Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration. This method is intended for use with other ecosystem metrics in inventories of ecosystem integrity, in planning ecosystem management activities, and in setting and measuring progress toward conservation or restoration goals.

TI  - Supply Chain Inventory Management and the Value of Shared Information
DO  - 10.1287/MNSC.46.8.1032.12029
PY  - 2000///
AB  - In traditional supply chain inventory management, orders are the only information firms exchange, but information technology now allows firms to share demand and inventory data quickly and inexpensively. We study the value of sharing these data in a model with one supplier, N identical retailers, and stationary stochastic consumer demand. There are inventory holding costs and back-order penalty costs. We compare a traditional information policy that does not use shared information with a full information policy that does exploit shared information. In a numerical study we find that supply chain costs are 2.2% lower on average with the full information policy than with the traditional information policy, and the maximum difference is 12.1%. We also develop a simulation-based lower bound over all feasible policies. The cost difference between the traditional information policy and the lower bound is an upper bound on the value of information sharing: In the same study, that difference is 3.4% on average, and no more than 13.8%. We contrast the value of information sharing with two other benefits of information technology, faster and cheaper order processing, which lead to shorter lead times and smaller batch sizes, respectively. In our sample, cutting lead times nearly in half reduces costs by 21% on average, and cutting batches in half reduces costs by 22% on average. For the settings we study, we conclude that implementing information technology to accelerate and smooth the physical flow of goods through a supply chain is significantly more valuable than using information technology to expand the flow of information.

TI  - The cougar approach to in-network query processing in sensor networks
DO  - 10.1145/601858.601861
PY  - 2002///
AB  - The widespread distribution and availability of small-scale sensors, actuators, and embedded processors is transforming the physical world into a computing platform. One such example is a sensor network consisting of a large number of sensor nodes that combine physical sensing capabilities such as temperature, light, or seismic sensors with networking and computation capabilities. Applications range from environmental control, warehouse inventory, and health care to military environments. Existing sensor networks assume that the sensors are preprogrammed and send data to a central frontend where the data is aggregated and stored for offline querying and analysis. This approach has two major drawbacks. First, the user cannot change the behavior of the system on the fly. Second, conservation of battery power is a major design factor, but a central system cannot make use of in-network programming, which trades costly communication for cheap local computation.In this paper, we introduce the Cougar approach to tasking sensor networks through declarative queries. Given a user query, a query optimizer generates an efficient query plan for in-network query processing, which can vastly reduce resource usage and thus extend the lifetime of a sensor network. In addition, since queries are asked in a declarative language, the user is shielded from the physical characteristics of the network. We give a short overview of sensor networks, propose a natural architecture for a data management system for sensor networks, and describe open research problems in this area.

TI  - Misperceptions of Feedback in a Dynamic Decision Making Experiment
DO  - 10.1287/MNSC.35.3.321
PY  - 1989///
AB  - Studies in the psychology of individual choice have identified numerous cognitive and other bounds on human rationality, often producing systematic errors and biases. Yet for the most part models of aggregate phenomena in management science and economics are not consistent with such micro-empirical knowledge of individual decision-making. One explanation has been the difficulty of extending the experimental methods used to study individual decisions to aggregate, dynamic settings. This paper reports an experiment on the generation of macrodynamics from microstructure in a common managerial context. Subjects manage a simulated inventory distribution system which contains multiple actors, feedbacks, nonlinearities, and time delays. The interaction of individual decisions with the structure of the simulated firm produces aggregate dynamics which systematically diverge from optimal behavior. An anchoring and adjustment heuristic for stock management is proposed as a model of the subjects' decision processes. Econometric tests show the rule explains the subjects' behavior well. The estimation results identify several `misperceptions of feedback' which account for the poor performance of the subjects. In particular, subjects are shown to be insensitive to the feedbacks from their decisions to the environment. Finally, the generality of the results is considered and implications for behavioral theories of aggregate social and economic dynamics are explored.

PY  - 2006///
AB  - One of the most common descriptors of the relationship between root and shoot biomass is the root : shoot ratio, which has become a core method for estimating root biomass from the more easily measured shoot biomass. Previous reviews have examined root : shoot ratio data, but have only considered particular vegetation types and have not always critically reviewed the data used. Reliable root : shoot ratios are needed for a wide range of vegetation types in order to improve the accuracy of root biomass estimates, including those required for estimating the effects of land management and land use change in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

PY  - 1997///
AB  - In this paper, we document a structural break in the volatility of U.S. GDP growth in the first quarter of 1984 and provide evidence that this break emanates from a reduction in the volatility of durable goods production. Further, the reduction in durables volatility corresponds to a decline in the share of durable goods accounted for by inventories. We find no evidence of increased stability in the nondurables, services or structures sectors of the economy. Our evidence is compatible with a scenario in which changes in inventory management techniques in the durable goods sector have reduced the variability of aggregate output.

PY  - 1998///
AB  - Summary This paper reports the development and psychometric validation of a multi-dimensional measure of facet-specific climate for innovation within groups at work: the Team Climate Inventory (TCI). Brief reviews of the organizational climate and work group innovation literatures are presented initially, and the need for measures of facet-specific climate at the level of the proximal work group asserted. The four-factor theory of facet-specific climate for innovation, which was derived from these reviews, is described, and the procedures used to operationalize this model into the original version measure described. Data attesting to underlying factor structure, internal homogeneity, predictive validity and factor replicability across groups of the summarized measure are presented. An initial sample of 155 individuals from 27 hospital management teams provided data for the exploratory factor analysis of this measure. Responses from 121 further groups in four occupations (35 primary health care teams, 42 social services teams, 20 psychiatric teams and 24 oil company teams; total Na 971) were used to apply confirmatory factor analysis techniques. This five-factor, 38-item summarized version demonstrates robust psychometric properties, with acceptable levels of reliability and validity. Potential applications of this measure are described and the implication of these findings for the measurement of proximal work group climate are discussed. #1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Big data analytics is critical in modern operations management (OM). In this study, we first explore the existing big data‐related analytics techniques, and identify their strengths, weaknesses as well as major functionalities. We then discuss various big data analytics strategies to overcome the respective computational and data challenges. After that, we examine the literature and reveal how different types of big data methods (techniques, strategies, and architectures) can be applied to different OM topical areas, namely forecasting, inventory management, revenue management and marketing, transportation management, supply chain management, and risk analysis. We also investigate via case studies the real‐world applications of big data analytics in top branded enterprises. Finally, we conclude the study with a discussion of future research.

PY  - 2019///
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to encourage the study of blockchain technology from an operations and supply chain management (OSCM) perspective, identifying potential areas of application, and to provide an agenda for future research.Design/methodology/approachAn explanation and analysis of blockchain technology is provided to identify implications for the field of OSCM.FindingsThe hype around the opportunities that digital ledger technologies offer is high. For OSCM, a myriad of ways in which blockchain could transform practice are identified, including enhancing product safety and security; improving quality management; reducing illegal counterfeiting; improving sustainable supply chain management; advancing inventory management and replenishment; reducing the need for intermediaries; impacting new product design and development; and reducing the cost of supply chain transactions. The immature state of practice and research surrounding blockchain means there is an opportunity for OSCM researchers to study the technology in its early stages and shape its adoption.Research limitations/implicationsThe paper provides a platform for new research that addresses gaps in knowledge and advances the field of OSCM. A research agenda is developed around six key themes.Practical implicationsThere are many opportunities for organisations to obtain an advantage by making use of blockchain technology ahead of the competition, enabling them to enhance their market position. But it is important that managers examine the characteristics of their products, services and supply chains to determine whether they need or would benefit sufficiently from the adoption of blockchain. Moreover, it is important that organisations build human capital expertise that allows them to develop, implement and exploit applications of this technology to maximum reward.Originality/valueThis is one of the first papers in a leading international OSCM journal to analyse blockchain technology, thereby complementing a recent article on digital supply chains that omitted blockchain.

TI  - Aboveground Forest Biomass and the Global Carbon Balance
DO  - 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.00955.x
PY  - 2005///
AB  - The long‐term net flux of carbon between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere has been dominated by two factors: changes in the area of forests and per hectare changes in forest biomass resulting from management and regrowth. While these factors are reasonably well documented in countries of the northern mid‐latitudes as a result of systematic forest inventories, they are uncertain in the tropics. Recent estimates of carbon emissions from tropical deforestation have focused on the uncertainty in rates of deforestation. By using the same data for biomass, however, these studies have underestimated the total uncertainty of tropical emissions and may have biased the estimates. In particular, regional and country‐specific estimates of forest biomass reported by three successive assessments of tropical forest resources by the FAO indicate systematic changes in biomass that have not been taken into account in recent estimates of tropical carbon emissions. The ‘changes’ more likely represent improved information than real on‐the‐ground changes in carbon storage. In either case, however, the data have a significant effect on current estimates of carbon emissions from the tropics and, hence, on understanding the global carbon balance.

AB  - In this classic book, first published in 1962, L. R. Ford, Jr., and D. R. Fulkerson set the foundation for the study of network flow problems. The models and algorithms introduced in Flows in Networks are used widely today in the fields of transportation systems, manufacturing, inventory planning, image processing, and Internet traffic. The techniques presented by Ford and Fulkerson spurred the development of powerful computational tools for solving and analyzing network flow models, and also furthered the understanding of linear programming. In addition, the book helped illuminate and unify results in combinatorial mathematics while emphasizing proofs based on computationally efficient construction. Flows in Networks is rich with insights that remain relevant to current research in engineering, management, and other sciences. This landmark work belongs on the bookshelf of every researcher working with networks.

TI  - The Big Data Newsvendor: Practical Insights from Machine Learning
DO  - 10.1287/opre.2018.1757
PY  - 2019///
AB  - In Ban and Rudin’s (2018) “The Big Data Newsvendor: Practical Insights from Machine Learning,” the authors take an innovative machine-learning approach to a classic problem solved by almost every company, every day, for inventory management. By allowing companies to use large amounts of data to predict the correct answers to decisions directly, they avoid intermediate questions, such as “how many customers will we get tomorrow?” and instead can tell the company how much inventory to stock for these customers. This has implications for almost all other decision-making problems considered in operations research, which has traditionally considered data estimation separately from the decision optimization. Their proposed methods are shown to work both analytically and empirically with the latter explored in a hospital nurse staffing example in which the best one-step, feature-based newsvendor algorithm (the kernel-weights optimization method) is shown to beat the best-practice benchmark by 24% in the out-of-sample cost at a fraction of the speed.

AB  - Lean production may have a significant public good spillover—improved environmental performance. However, empirical evidence of the link between lean production practices and environmental performance has not resolved the nature of the relationship. To explore this issue, we conduct an empirical analysis of the environmental performance of 17,499 U.S. manufacturing establishments during the time period 1991–1996. We find that those establishments that adopt the quality management standard ISO 9000 are more likely to adopt the environmental management standard ISO 14000. We also find strong evidence that lean production, as measured by ISO 9000 adoption and low chemical inventories, is complementary to waste reduction and pollution reduction.

TI  - WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND PROFITABILITY-CASE OF PAKISTANI FIRMS
PY  - 2007///
AB  - Working Capital Management has its effect on liquidity as well on profitability of the firm. In this research, we have selected a sample of 94 Pakistani firms listed on Karachi Stock Exchange for a period of 6 years from 1999 – 2004, we have studied the effect of different variables of working capital management including the Average collection period, Inventory turnover in days, Average payment period, Cash conversion cycle and Current ratio on the Net operating profitability of Pakistani firms. Debt ratio, size of the firm (measured in terms of natural logarithm of sales) and financial assets to total assets ratio have been used as control variables. Pearson’s correlation, and regression analysis (Pooled least square and general least square with cross section weight models) are used for analysis. The results show that there is a strong negative relationship between variables of the working capital management and profitability of the firm. It means that as the cash conversion cycle increases it will lead to decreasing profitability of the firm, and managers can create a positive value for the shareholders by reducing the cash conversion cycle to a possible minimum level. We find that there is a significant negative relationship between liquidity and profitability. We also find that there is a positive relationship between size of the firm and its profitability. There is also a significant negative relationship between debt used by the firm and its profitability.

PY  - 2006///
AB  - Purpose - The object of the research presented in this paper is to provide empirical evidence on the effects of working capital management on the profitability of a sample of small and medium-sized Spanish firms. Design/methodology/approach - The authors have collected a panel of 8,872 small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) covering the period 1996-2002. The authors tested the effects of working capital management on SME profitability using the panel data methodology. Findings - The results, which are robust to the presence of endogeneity, demonstrate that managers can create value by reducing their inventories and the number of days for which their accounts are outstanding. Moreover, shortening the cash conversion cycle also improves the firm's profitability. Originality/value - This work contributes to the literature in two ways. First, no previous such evidence exists for the case of SMEs. Second, unlike previous studies, in the current work robust test have been conducted for the possible presence of endogeneity problems. The aim is to ensure that the relationships found in the analysis carried out are due to the effects of the cash conversion cycle on corporate profitability and not vice versa.

TI  - Remote Sensing Technologies for Enhancing Forest Inventories: A Review
DO  - 10.1080/07038992.2016.1207484
PY  - 2016///
AB  - Abstract Forest inventory and management requirements are changing rapidly in the context of an increasingly complex set of economic, environmental, and social policy objectives. Advanced remote sensing technologies provide data to assist in addressing these escalating information needs and to support the subsequent development and parameterization of models for an even broader range of information needs. This special issue contains papers that use a variety of remote sensing technologies to derive forest inventory or inventory-related information. Herein, we review the potential of 4 advanced remote sensing technologies, which we posit as having the greatest potential to influence forest inventories designed to characterize forest resource information for strategic, tactical, and operational planning: airborne laser scanning (ALS), terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP), and high spatial resolution (HSR)/very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite optical imagery. ALS, in particular, has proven to be a transformative technology, offering forest inventories the required spatial detail and accuracy across large areas and a diverse range of forest types. The coupling of DAP with ALS technologies will likely have the greatest impact on forest inventory practices in the next decade, providing capacity for a broader suite of attributes, as well as for monitoring growth over time.

DO  - 10.2737/SRS-GTR-80
PY  - 2005///
AB  - Addendum: The supplementary documents referenced in this manuscript are posted on the Web site https://www.fia.fs.fed.us/library/sampling/index.phpThe Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service is in the process of moving from a system of quasiindependent, regional, periodic inventories to an enhanced program featuring greater national consistency, annual measurement of a proportion of plots in each State, new reporting requirements, and integration with the ground sampling component of the Forest Health Monitoring Program. This documentation presents an overview of the conceptual changes, explains the three phases of FIA's sampling design, describes the sampling frame and plot configuration, presents the estimators that form the basis of FIA's National Information Management System (NIMS), and shows how annual data are combined for analysis. It also references a number of Web-based supplementary documents that provide greater detail about some of the more obscure aspects of the sampling and estimation system, as well as examples of calculations for most of the common estimators produced by FIA.

TI  - Thirty Years of Inventory Routing
DO  - 10.1287/trsc.2013.0472
PY  - 2014///
AB  - The inventory-routing problem (IRP) dates back 30 years. It can be described as the combination of vehicle-routing and inventory management problems, in which a supplier has to deliver products to a number of geographically dispersed customers, subject to side constraints. It provides integrated logistics solutions by simultaneously optimizing inventory management, vehicle routing, and delivery scheduling. Some exact algorithms and several powerful metaheuristic and matheuristic approaches have been developed for this class of problems, especially in recent years. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of this literature, based on a new classification of the problem. We categorize IRPs with respect to their structural variants and the availability of information on customer demand.

TI  - Changes in Forest Biomass Carbon Storage in China Between 1949 and 1998
DO  - 10.1126/SCIENCE.1058629
PY  - 2001///
AB  - The location and mechanisms responsible for the carbon sink in northern mid-latitude lands are uncertain. Here, we used an improved estimation method of forest biomass and a 50-year national forest resource inventory in China to estimate changes in the storage of living biomass between 1949 and 1998. Our results suggest that Chinese forests released about 0.68 petagram of carbon between 1949 and 1980, for an annual emission rate of 0.022 petagram of carbon. Carbon storage increased significantly after the late 1970s from 4.38 to 4.75 petagram of carbon by 1998, for a mean accumulation rate of 0.021 petagram of carbon per year, mainly due to forest expansion and regrowth. Since the mid-1970s, planted forests (afforestation and reforestation) have sequestered 0.45 petagram of carbon, and their average carbon density increased from 15.3 to 31.1 megagrams per hectare, while natural forests have lost an additional 0.14 petagram of carbon, suggesting that carbon sequestration through forest management practices addressed in the Kyoto Protocol could help offset industrial carbon dioxide emissions.

TI  - Integration of Online and Offline Channels in Retail: The Impact of Sharing Reliable Inventory Availability Information
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.2014.1951
PY  - 2014///
AB  - Using a proprietary data set, we analyze the impact of the implementation of a “buy-online, pick-up-in-store” BOPS project. The implementation of this project is associated with a reduction in online sales and an increase in store sales and traffic. These results can be explained by two simultaneous phenomena: 1 additional store sales from customers who use the BOPS functionality and buy additional products in the stores cross-selling effect and 2 the shift of some customers from the online to the brick-and-mortar channel and the conversion of noncustomers into store customers channel-shift effect. We explain these channel-shift patterns as an increase in “research online, purchase offline” behavior enabled by BOPS implementation, and we validate this explanation with evidence from the change of cart abandonment and conversion rates of the brick-and-mortar and online channels. We interpret these results in light of recent operations management literature that analyzes the impact of sharing inventory availability information. Our analysis illustrates the limitations of drawing conclusions about complex interventions using single-channel data. This paper was accepted by Alok Gupta, special issue on business analytics.

TI  - A Unified Theory of Tobin's Q, Corporate Investment, Financing, and Risk Management
DO  - 10.1111/j.1540-6261.2011.01681.x
PY  - 2009///
AB  - This paper proposes a simple homogeneous dynamic model of investment and corporate risk management for a financially constrained firm. Following Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein (1993), we define a corporation's risk management as the coordination of investment and financing decisions. In our model, corporate risk management involves internal liquidity management, financial hedging, and investment. We determine a firm's optimal cash, investment, asset sales, credit line, external equity finance, and payout policies as functions of the following key parameters: 1) the firm's earnings growth and cash-flow risk; 2) the external cost of financing; 3) the firm's liquidation value; 4) the opportunity cost of holding cash; 5) investment adjustment and asset sales costs; and 6) the return and covariance characteristics of hedging assets the firm can invest in. The optimal cash inventory policy takes the form of a double-barrier policy where i) cash is paid out to shareholders only when the cash-capital ratio hits an endogenous upper barrier, and ii) external funds are raised only when the firm has depleted its cash. In between the two barriers, the firm adjusts its capital expenditures, asset sales, and hedging policies. Several new insights emerge from our analysis. For example, we find an inverse relation between marginal Tobin's q and investment when the firm draws on its credit line. We also find that financially constrained firms may have a lower equity beta in equilibrium because these firms tend to hold higher precautionary cash inventories.

PY  - 1991///
AB  - Ten conditions of trust were suggested by 84 interviews of managers, and two previous studies of managerial trust. Statements made in the interviews and the studies were used to develop a content theory of trust conditions and derive scales measuring them. The scales were generated with an iterative procedure using a total of 1531 management students. The scales were assessed for homogeneity, reliability, and validity with several samples: 180 managers and 173 of their subordinates, 111 machine operators, and four different samples of management students (n = 380, n = 129, n = 290, and n = 132). Construct validity was supported by showing that the scale measures behaved as hypothesized with respect to measures of other variables, a manipulation of expectations, and the reciprocity of trust in vertical dyads.

TI  - The effectiveness of exercise as an intervention in the management of depression: systematic review and meta-regression analysis of randomised controlled trials
DO  - 10.1136/bmj.322.7289.763
PY  - 2001///
AB  - Abstract Objective: To determine the effectiveness of exercise as an intervention in the management of depression. Design: Systematic review and meta-regression analysis of randomised controlled trials obtained from five electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Sports Discus, PsycLIT, Cochrane Library) and through contact with experts in the field, bibliographic searches, and hand searches of recent copies of relevant journals. Main outcome measures: Standardised mean difference in effect size and weighted mean difference in Beck depression inventory score between exercise and no treatment and between exercise and cognitive therapy. Results: All of the 14 studies analysed had important methodological weaknesses; randomisation was adequately concealed in only three studies, intention to treat analysis was undertaken in only two, and assessment of outcome was blinded in only one. The participants in most studies were community volunteers, and diagnosis was determined by their score on the Beck depression inventory. When compared with no treatment, exercise reduced symptoms of depression (standardised mean difference in effect size −1.1 (95% confidence interval −1.5 to −0.6); weighted mean difference in Beck depression inventory −7.3 (−10.0 to −4.6)). The effect size was significantly greater in those trials with shorter follow up and in two trials reported only as conference abstracts. The effect of exercise was similar to that of cognitive therapy (standardised mean difference −0.3 (95% confidence interval −0.7 to 0.1)). Conclusions: The effectiveness of exercise in reducing symptoms of depression cannot be determined because of a lack of good quality research on clinical populations with adequate follow up. What is already known on this topic Depression is common Management is often inadequate and many patients do not comply with antidepressant medication The effect of exercise on depression has been a subject of interest for many years What this study adds Most studies of the effect of exercise on depression are of poor quality, have brief follow up, and are undertaken on non-clinical volunteers Exercise may be efficacious in reducing symptoms of depression in the short term but its effectiveness in clinical populations is unknown A well designed, randomised controlled trial with long term follow up is needed

AB  - Mobile money is a tool that allows individuals to make financial transactions using cell phone technology. In this paper, we report initial results of two rounds of a large survey of households in Kenya, the country that has seen perhaps the most rapid and widespread growth of a mobile money product - known locally as M‐PESA - in the developing world. We first summarize the mechanics of M-PESA, and review its potential economic impacts. We then document the sequencing of adoption across households according to income and wealth, location, gender, and other socio‐economic characteristics, as well as the purposes for which the technology is used, including saving, sending and receiving remittances, and direct purchases of goods and services. In addition, we report findings from a survey of M‐PESA agents, who provide cash‐in and cash‐out services, and highlight the inventory management problems they face.

TI  - TRENDS IN WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND ITS IMPACT ON FIRMS, PERFORMANCE: AN ANALYSIS OF MAURITIAN SMALL MANUFACTURING FIRMS
PY  - 2006///
AB  - A well designed and implemented working capital management is expected to contribute positively to the creation of a firm’s value The purpose of this paper is to examine the trends in working capital management and its impact on firms’ performance. The trend in working capital needs and profitability of firms are examined to identify the causes for any significant differences between the industries. The dependent variable, return on total assets is used as a measure of profitability and the relation between working capital management and corporate profitability is investigated for a sample of 58 small manufacturing firms, using panel data analysis for the period 1998 – 2003. The regression results show that high investment in inventories and receivables is associated with lower profitability. The key variables used in the analysis are inventories days, accounts receivables days, accounts payable days and cash conversion cycle. A strong significant relationship between working capital management and profitability has been found in previous empirical work. An analysis of the liquidity, profitability and operational efficiency of the five industries shows significant changes and how best practices in the paper industry have contributed to performance. The findings also reveal an increasing trend in the short-term component of working capital financing.

TI  - The Bullwhip Effect in Supply Chains
DO  - 10.4018/978-1-4666-5202-6.CH222
PY  - 2014///
AB  - The bullwhip effect is an amplification of demand variability that affects supply chains. A company is subject to a bullwhip effect when customer demand leads to a change in inventory and purchases do not correspond to sales, thus leading to greater variability. The phenomenon may occur in cases of constant customer demand in a supply chain. It has been observed that supply chain demand variability increases upstream from end user to producer. The bullwhip effect is a well-studied phenomenon both in theory and practice. In critical study, research has been conducted on simulation, empirical investigations, business games and qualitative as well as quantitative approaches. On the one hand, there are studies that examine the occurrence of the bullwhip effect and others that examine its mitigation. Although extensive research has already been done on the bullwhip effect (Lee, Padmanabhan, & Whang, 1997a; Lee, Padmanabhan, & Whang, 1997b; see Disney, Farasyn, Lambrecht, Towill & Van de Velde 2006 for an excellent review of research done to date), it is still a challenging field of study: the bullwhip effect can only occur in supply chains and research is subsequently tied to supply chain management and its approaches. Supply chain management is subject to ongoing changes and developments as a result of globalization and technological innovation, which influence collaboration of supply chain partners. The resulting need for further research on supply chain management leads to research opportunities on the bullwhip effect. BACKGROUND

DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.2017.2799
PY  - 2017///
AB  - As an integrated part of a supply contract, trade credit has intrinsic connections with supply chain coordination and inventory management. Using a model that explicitly captures the interaction of firms’ operations decisions, financial constraints, and multiple financing channels (bank loans and trade credit), this paper attempts to better understand the risk-sharing role of trade credit—that is, how trade credit enhances supply chain efficiency by allowing the retailer to partially share the demand risk with the supplier. Within this role, in equilibrium, trade credit is an indispensable external source for inventory financing, even when the supplier is at a disadvantageous position in managing default relative to a bank. Specifically, the equilibrium trade credit contract is net terms when the retailer’s financial status is relatively strong. Accordingly, trade credit is the only external source that the retailer uses to finance inventory. By contrast, if the retailer’s cash level is low, the supplier ...

TI  - The Relationship Between Depression and Internet Addiction
DO  - 10.1089/cpb.1998.1.25
PY  - 1998///
AB  - Prior research has utilized the Zung Depression Inventory (ZDI) and found that moderate to severe rates of depression coexist with pathological Internet use.1 Although the ZDI was utilized for its expediency with on-line administration, its limitations include poor normative data and less frequent clinical use. Therefore, this study utilized the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), which has more accurate norms and frequent usage among dual diagnostic patient populations. An on-line survey administered on a World Wide Web site utilized the BDI as part of a larger study. A total of 312 surveys was collected with 259 valid profiles from addicted users, which again supported significant levels of depression to be associated with pathological Internet use. This article discusses how a treatment protocol should emphasis the primary psychiatric condition if related to a subsequent impulse control problem such as pathological Internet use. Effective management of psychiatric symptoms may indirectly correct pathologi...

DO  - 10.1027/1864-1105.20.3.106
PY  - 2008///
AB  - Investigated the relationship between self-reported (offline) personality traits and (online) self-presentation in social networking profiles on the Internet. Social networking sites like MySpace, Facebook, and StudiVZ are popular means of communicating personality. Recent theoretical and empirical considerations of homepages and Web 2.0 platforms show that impression management is a major motive for actively participating in social networking sites. 58 users (mean age 22.98 years) of the German Web 2.0 site, StudiVZ.net, completed online questionnaires assessing extraversion (NEO Personality Inventory, NEO-FFI), self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, RSES), and efficacy of self-presentation, and their profiles were subject to a content analysis. Findings reveal a slight influence of extraversion on self-presentation, whereas there was no significant effect for self-esteem. Moveover, analyses of respondents' profiles showed that self-efficacy with regard to impression management is strongly related to the number of virtual friends, the level of profile detail, and the style of the personal photo.

TI  - Life-Cycle Assessment and the Environmental Impact of Buildings: A Review
DO  - 10.3390/SU1030674
PY  - 2009///
AB  - Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) is one of various management tools for evaluating environmental concerns. This paper reviews LCA from a buildings perspective. It highlights the need for its use within the building sector, and the importance of LCA as a decision making support tool. It discusses LCA methodologies and applications within the building sector, reviewing some of the life-cycle studies applied to buildings or building materials and component combinations within the last fifteen years in Europe and the United States. It highlights the problems of a lack of an internationally comparable and agreed data inventory and assessment methodology which hinder the application of LCA within the building industry. It identifies key areas for future research as (i) the whole process of construction, (ii) the relative weighting of different environmental impacts and (iii) applications in developing countries.

TI  - Modeling Supply Chain Dynamics: A Multiagent Approach
DO  - 10.1111/J.1540-5915.1998.TB01356.X
PY  - 1998///
AB  - A global economy and increase in customer expectations in terms of cost and services have put a premium on effective supply chain reengineering. It is essential to perform risk-benefit analysis of reengineering alternatives before making a final decision. Simulation provides an effective pragmatic approach to detailed analysis and evaluation of supply chain design and management alternatives. However, the utility of this methodology is hampered by the time and effort required to develop models with sufficient fidelity to the actual supply chain of interest. In this paper, we describe a supply chain modeling framework designed to overcome this difficulty. Using our approach, supply chain models are composed from software components that represent types of supply chain agents (e.g., retailers, manufacturers, transporters), their constituent control elements (e.g., inventory policy), and their interaction protocols (e.g., message types). The underlying library of supply chain modeling components has been derived from analysis of several different supply chains. It provides a reusable base of domain-specific primitives that enables rapid development of customized decision support tools.

DO  - 10.1007/BF02994190
PY  - 2004///
AB  - Goal, Scope and BackgroundA consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) is designed to generate information on the consequences of decisions. This paper includes a comprehensive presentation of the consequential approach to system boundaries, allocation and data selection. It is based on a text produced within the SETAC-Europe working group on scenarios in LCA. For most of the methodological problems, we describe ideal methodological solutions as well as simplifications intended to make the method feasible in practice.MethodWe compile, summarize and refine descriptions of consequential methodology elements that have been presented in separate papers, in addition to methodological elements and general conclusions that have not previously been published.Results and ConclusionsA consequential LCA ideally includes activities within and outside the life cycle that are affected by a change within the life cycle of the product under investigation. In many cases this implies the use of marginal data and that allocation is typically avoided through system expansion. The model resulting from a consequential life cycle inventory (LCI) also includes the alternative use of constrained production factors as well as the marginal supply and demand on affected markets. As a result, the consequential LCI model does not resemble the traditional LCI model, where the main material flows are described from raw material extraction to waste management. Instead, it is a model of causal relationships originating at the decision at hand or the decision-maker that the LCI is intended to inform.

TI  - The Disclosure of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control after the Sarbanes‐Oxley Act
DO  - 10.2308/ACCH.2005.19.3.137
PY  - 2005///
AB  - This paper focuses on a sample of 261 companies that disclosed at least one material weakness in internal control in their SEC filings after the effective date of the Sarbanes‐Oxley Act of 2002. Based on the descriptive material weakness disclosures provided by management, we find that poor internal control is usually related to an insufficient commitment of resources for accounting controls. Material weaknesses in internal control tend to be related to deficient revenue‐recognition policies, lack of segregation of duties, deficiencies in the period‐end reporting process and accounting policies, and inappropriate account reconciliation. The most common account‐specific material weaknesses occur in the current accrual accounts, such as the accounts receivable and inventory accounts. Material weakness disclosures by management also frequently describe internal control problems in complex accounts, such as the derivative and income tax accounts. In our statistical analysis, we find that disclosing a material...

TI  - Information sharing in a supply chain
DO  - 10.1504/IJMTM.2000.001329
PY  - 2000///
AB  - Advances in information system technology have had a huge impact on the evolution of supply chain management. As a result of such technological advances, supply chain partners can now work in tight coordination to optimise the chain-wide performance, and the realised return may be shared among the partners. A basic enabler for tight coordination is information sharing, which has been greatly facilitated by the advances in information technology. This paper describes the types of information shared inventory, sales, demand forecast, order status, and production schedule. We discuss how and why this information is shared using industry examples and relating them to academic research. We also discuss three alternative system models of information sharing - the information transfer model, the third party model and the information hub model.

TI  - Unlocking the Value of RFID
DO  - 10.1111/J.1937-5956.2007.TB00165.X
PY  - 2007///
AB  - RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) technology has shown itself to be a promising technology to track movements of goods in a supply chain. As such, it can give unprecedented visibility to the supply chain. Such visibility can save labor cost, improve supply chain coordination, reduce inventory and increase product availability. Industry reports and white papers are now filled with estimates and proclamations of the benefits and quantified values of RFID. Early adopters are now rallying more and more followers. However, most such claims are educated guesses at best and are not substantiated, that is, they are not based on detailed, model-based analysis. This paper argues that there is a huge credibility gap of the value of RFID, and that a void exists in showing how the proclaimed values are arrived at, and how those values can be realized. The paper shows that this credibility gap must be filled with solid model analysis, and therefore presents a great opportunity for the Production and Operations Management (POM) research community. The paper reviews some of the ongoing research efforts that attempt to close the credibility gap, and suggests additional directions for further strengthening the POM's contribution to help industry realize the full potentials of RFID.

TI  - Good practice guidance and uncertainty management in national greenhouse gas inventories
PY  - 2000///
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to support the development of so-called good practice guidelines for the estimation of methane (CH 4) emissions from solid waste (SW) disposal for national greenhouse gas inventories. The paper reviews and discusses the emission estimation methods given in the IPCC 1996 Revised Guidelines (IPCC Guidelines), and uncertainty and quality management issues related to the emission estimation. At solid waste disposal sites (SWDS) the degradable organic carbon in waste is decomposed by bacteria under anaerobic conditions into methane (CH 4) and other compounds. The CH 4 emissions from SWDS are important contributors of global anthropogenic CH 4 emissions. The IPCC Guidelines give two methods for estimation CH 4 emissions from solid waste disposal. The IPCC default method is a simple mass balance calculation which estimates the amount of CH 4 emitted from the SWDS assuming that all CH 4 is released the same year the waste is disposed of. The other method outlined in the IPCC Guidelines is the so-called First Order Decay (FOD) method. The FOD method takes the time factors of the degradation process into account, and produces annual emission estimates that reflect this process, which can take years, even decades. The estimates on annual emissions produced by the two methods are therefore not comparable. The FOD method produces better estimates on annual emissions, whereas the IPCC default method has merits e.g. in studies comparing the potential to reduce the CH 4 emissions by alternative waste treatment methods. The use of the IPCC default method and FOD method require as input annual SW disposal data including information on the composition of the waste and on the conditions at the SWDS. The IPCC default method requires this data only for the inventory years, whereas the FOD method requires data for also the past 20-25 or more years. In addition, the rate of degradation for waste disposed at SWDS needs to be determined in the FOD method. The IPCC Guidelines contain default values for most of the data needed in the use of the default method, whereas the guidance and default values needed in the use of the FOD method are insufficient. The uncertainties in the emission estimates produced by both the IPCC method and the FOD method are large in most countries. Even few industrialised countries have good SW disposal data based on weighing of amounts disposed and frequent sampling to determine the composition …

TI  - Online Network Revenue Management Using Thompson Sampling
DO  - 10.1287/opre.2018.1755
PY  - 2018///
AB  - Thompson sampling is a randomized Bayesian machine learning method, whose original motivation was to sequentially evaluate treatments in clinical trials. In recent years, this method has drawn wide attention, as Internet companies have successfully implemented it for online ad display. In “Online network revenue management using Thompson sampling,” K. Ferreira, D. Simchi-Levi, and H. Wang propose using Thompson sampling for a revenue management problem where the demand function is unknown. A main challenge to adopt Thompson sampling for revenue management is that the original method does not incorporate inventory constraints. However, the authors show that Thompson sampling can be naturally combined with a linear program formulation to include inventory constraints. The result is a dynamic pricing algorithm that incorporates domain knowledge and has strong theoretical performance guarantees as well as promising numerical performance results. Interestingly, the authors demonstrate that Thompson sampling achieves poor performance when it does not take into account domain knowledge. Finally, the proposed dynamic pricing algorithm is highly flexible and is applicable in a range of industries, from airlines and internet advertising all the way to online retailing.

TI  - FIREMON: Fire Effects Monitoring and Inventory System
DO  - 10.2737/rmrs-gtr-164
PY  - 2012///
AB  - Monitoring and inventory to assess the effects of wildland fire is critical for 1) documenting fire effects, 2) assessing ecosystem damage and benefit, 3) evaluating the success or failure of a burn, and 4) appraising the potential for future treatments. However, monitoring fire effects is often difficult because data collection requires abundant funds, resources, and sampling experience. Often, the reason fire monitoring projects are not implemented is because fire management agencies do not have scientifically based, standardized protocols for inventorying pre- and postfire conditions that satisfy their monitoring and management objectives. We have developed a comprehensive system, called the Fire Effects Monitoring and Inventory System (FIREMON), which is designed to satisfy fire management agencies' monitoring and inventory requirements for most ecosystems, fuel types, and geographic areas in the United States. FIREMON consists of standardized sampling methods and manuals, field forms, database, analysis program, and an image analysis guide so that fire managers can 1) design a fire effects monitoring project, 2) collect and store the sampled data, 3) statistically analyze and summarize the data, 4) link the data with satellite imagery, and 5) map the sampled data across the landscape using image processing. FIREMON allows flexible but comprehensive sampling of fire effects so data can be evaluated for significant impacts, shared across agencies, and used to update and refine fire management plans and prescriptions. FIREMON has a flexible structure that allows the modification of sampling methods and local code fields to allow the sampling of locally important fire effects evaluation criteria.More information: https://www.frames.gov/partner-sites/firemon/firemon-home/

PY  - 2001///
AB  - On the morning of September 11th, 2001, the United States and the Western world entered into a new era ‐ one in which large scale terrorist acts are to be expected. The impacts of the new era will challenge supply chain managers to adjust relations with suppliers and customers, contend with transportation difficulties and amend inventory management strategies. This paper looks at the twin corporate challenges of (i) preparing to deal with the aftermath of terrorist attacks and (ii) operating under heightened security. The first challenge involves setting certain operational redundancies. The second means less reliable lead times and less certain demand scenarios. In addition, the paper looks at how companies should organize to meet those challenges efficiently and suggests a new public‐private partnership. While the paper is focused on the US, it has worldwide implications.

TI  - Supply chain coordination with emissions reduction incentives
DO  - 10.1080/00207543.2011.651656
PY  - 2013///
AB  - The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) is considered one of the main legislative systems that are set up to reduce emissions and protect the environment. Most of the works in the literature approach this system from a legislation and/or global point of view. Little has been done to examine this system from the perspective of the user. This work is believed to be the first to consider the EU-ETS system in a supply chain and operations management context. A two-level (vendor–buyer) supply chain model with a coordination mechanism is presented while accounting for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from manufacturing processes. Different emissions trading schemes are considered, and possible combinations between these schemes are presented. The developed model could be found useful by mangers who wish to jointly minimise the inventory-related and GHG emissions costs of their supply chains when penalties for exceeding emissions limits are considered. Numerical examples are presented, and results are discussed.

TI  - Urban air quality management-A review
DO  - 10.5094/APR.2015.033
PY  - 2015///
AB  - Urban air quality management plan (UAQMP) is an effective and efficient tool employed in managing acceptable urban air quality. However, the UAQM practices are specific to a country’s needs and requirements. Majority of the developed countries have full–fledged UAQMP with a regulatory management framework. However, developing countries are still working in formulating the effective and efficient UAQMPs to manage their deteriorating urban air environment. The first step in the process of formulation of UAQMP is to identify the air quality control regions based on ambient air quality status and second, initiate a time bound program involving all stakeholders to develop UAQMPs. The successful implementation of UAQMPs depends on the strength of its key components, e.g. goal/objective, monitoring network, emission inventory, air quality modeling, control strategies and public participation. This paper presents a comprehensive review on UAQMPs, being implemented worldwide at different scales e.g., national (macro), city (medium), and local (micro).

DO  - 10.1080/23302674.2016.1240254
PY  - 2018///
AB  - ABSTRACTIncorporation of quality and environmental concerns in production and inventory models has received considerable attention in the inventory management literature; however, researchers studied these topics mostly independently. Thus, it is required to jointly incorporate those two relevant aspects in a single research to support decisions, compare the results and obtain new insights for complexities in practice. This paper takes a step in this line of thought and revisits some economic order quantity (EOQ) models with imperfect quality from a sustainable point of view. The objective is to investigate the impact of emission costs on the replenishment order sizes and the total profit of a buyer (retailer) in an imperfect supply process, where the buyer receives the batches containing a percentage of imperfect quality items. First, an EOQ model with imperfect quality items and emission costs, which are the result of warehousing and waste disposal activities, is formulated. Next, the model is extended ...

AB  - Wetland management is today receiving far greater attention within the framework of both general and specific conservation policies. Many jurisdictions have realised the full value of their wetland resources and have begun to implement specific management activities. For these activities they require further information to ensure the resources are managed and used in a wise manner. Information on the current status of wetlands, the extent of wetland loss and degradation, conservation procedures and the success of monitoring strategies is required. This information can be collected through ongoing wetland inventory (incorporating classification) and monitoring programs. Wetland managers in northern Australia can draw upon an increasing amount of information from other regions of the world, but they will still need an interactive inventory process to provide locally relevant information. Management actions also require monitoring to ensure their effectiveness. In turn, monitoring requires the support of management procedures to ensure it is effective and that the outcomes are interpreted and acted upon. A management plan can provide such procedures and ensure that the available information is presented in a form that can be readily used for management actions.

TI  - Modeling Supply Chain Contracts: A Review
DO  - 10.1007/978-1-4615-4949-9_10
PY  - 1999///
AB  - In this review, we summarize model-based research on contracts in the supply chain setting and provide a taxonomy for work in this area. During our discussions it became clear that the field has developed in many directions at once. Furthermore, as we surveyed the Uterature, it was not obvious what constitutes a contract in this context. While the nomenclature “supply chain management” is relatively new, many of the problems that are addressed are not. In particular, mathematical models for optimizing inventory control have a long history as a significant part of the mainstream of operations research and operations management. Inventory modeling, per se, dates to the early part of the century and the ideas of a Westinghouse engineer named Ford Harris (1915). A natural issue to address first is what is meant by supply chain management (SCM) research and how it relates to the vast body of work constituting classical inventory theory.

DO  - 10.1136/bmj.38782.575868.7C
PY  - 2006///
AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of a training and support intervention for nursing home staff in reducing the proportion of residents with dementia who are prescribed neuroleptics. Design Cluster randomised controlled trial with blinded assessment of outcome. Setting 12 specialist nursing homes for people with dementia in London, Newcastle, and Oxford. Participants Residents of the 12 nursing homes; numbers varied during the study period. Intervention Training and support intervention delivered to nursing home staff over 10 months, focusing on alternatives to drugs for the management of agitated behaviour in dementia. Main outcome measures Proportion of residents in each home who were prescribed neuroleptics and mean levels of agitated and disruptive behaviour (Cohen-Mansfield agitation inventory) in each home at 12 months. Results At 12 months the proportion of residents taking neuroleptics in the intervention homes (23.0%) was significantly lower than that in the control homes (42.1%): average reduction in neuroleptic use 19.1% (95% confidence interval 0.5% to 37.7%). No significant differences were found in the levels of agitated or disruptive behaviour between intervention and control homes. Conclusions Promotion of person centred care and good practice in the management of patients with dementia with behavioural symptoms provides an effective alternative to neuroleptics.

TI  - Costing psychiatric interventions.
PY  - 1992///
AB  - The demands and needs for cost information in psychiatric contexts have multiplied considerably in recent years, but have often been frustrated by inadequate data. The typical costs data available to the policy maker, manager, clinical professional or researcher have been dominated until recently by age-old accounting practices and line management arrangements, and constrained by fragmentation of responsibility. Most limiting of all, costs data have rarely been used in taking decisions about individual cases. In considering the demands and needs for costs in psychiatry, this chapter describes a research instrument - the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) - which has been developed and extensively applied in order to meet some of these needs. The chapter includes illustrations of applications of data recorded using the CSRI.

TI  - Monitoring the Vernal Advancement and Retrogradation (Green Wave Effect) of Natural Vegetation. [Great Plains Corridor]
PY  - 1973///
AB  - The author has identified the following significant results. Emphasis has been given to an inventory of land resource types and land use at the ten Great Plains Corridor test sites. A resource and land use classification system was developed which uses available soil survey information and interpretations from NASA obtained high flight aerial photography to locate discrete areas of similar rangeland vegetation. Existing classification systems, even those developed for use with remote sensor data, were found to be inadequate for this project. This system is expected to be of general use for remote sensing related to land use and management. It has specific applicability to any effort aimed at regional use of ERTS-1 MSS digital data products. A preliminary assessment of the relative importance of rangelands in the Great Plains Corridor states indicates that the value of the livestock industry supported by this resource exceeds 23 billion dollars. The development of a Rangeland Feed Conditions index for this region could be used by more than 400,000 farm and ranch operators involved in the production of more than 40% of the nation's beef and much of the country's grain.

TI  - Inventory Management with Asset-Based Financing
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.1040.0278
PY  - 2004///
AB  - Most of the traditional models in production and inventory control ignore the financial states of an organization and can lead to infeasible practices in real systems. This paper is the first attempt to incorporate asset-based financing into production decisions. Instead of setting a known, exogenously determined budgetary constraint as most existing models suggest, we model the available cash in each period as a function of assets and liabilities that may be updated periodically according to the dynamics of the production activities. Furthermore, our models allow different interest rates on cash balance and outstanding loans, which is an enhancement over most traditional models in that inventory financed by a loan may be more expensive than that by out-of-pocket cash. We demonstrate the importance of joint consideration of production and financing decisions in a start-up setting in which the ability to grow the firm is mainly constrained by its limited capital and dependence on bank financing. We then explain the motivation for asset-based financing by examining the decision making at a bank and a set of retailers in a newsvendor setting.

DO  - 10.1027//1015-5759.17.3.222
PY  - 2001///
AB  - Summary: Four studies are presented investigating the convergent validity, discriminant validity, and relationship with age of the Social Desirability Scale-17 (SDS-17). As to convergent validity, SDS-17 scores showed correlations between .52 and .85 with other measures of social desirability (Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Lie Scale, Sets of Four Scale, Marlowe-Crowne Scale). Moreover, scores were highly sensitive to social-desirability-provoking instructions (job-application instruction). Finally, with respect to the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding, SDS-17 scores showed a unique correlation with impression management, but not with self-deception. As to discriminant validity, SDS-17 scores showed nonsignificant correlations with neuroticism, extraversion, psychoticism, and openness to experience, whereas there was some overlap with agreeableness and conscientiousness. With respect to relationship with age, the SDS-17 was administered in a sample stratified for age, with age ranging from 18 ...

TI  - Managing Perishable and Aging Inventories: Review and Future Research Directions
DO  - 10.1007/978-1-4419-6485-4_15
PY  - 2011///
AB  - Over the years, several companies have emerged as exemplary of “best practices” in supply chain management; for example, Wal-Mart is frequently cited as using unique strategies to lead its market. One significant challenge for Wal-Mart is managing inventories of products that frequently outdate: A significant portion of Wal-Mart’s product portfolio consists of perishable products such as food items (varying from fresh produce to dairy to bakery products), pharmaceuticals (e.g., drugs, vitamins, cosmetics), chemicals (e.g., household cleaning products), and cut flowers. Wal-Mart’s supply chain is not alone in its exposure to outdating risks – to better appreciate the impact of perishability and outdating in society at large, consider these figures: In a 2003 survey, overall unsalable costs at distributors to supermarkets and drug stores in consumer packaged goods alone were estimated at $2.57 billion, and 22% of these costs, over 500 million dollars, were due to expiration in only the branded segment (Grocery Manufacturers of America 2004). In the produce sector, the $1.7 billion US apple industry is estimated to lose $300 million annually to spoilage (Webb 2006). Note also that perishability and outdating are a concern not only for these consumer goods, but for industrial products (for instance, Chen (2006), mentions that adhesive materials used for plywood lose strength within 7 days of production), military ordnance, and blood – one of the most critical resources in health care supply chains. According to a nationwide survey on blood collection and utilization, 5.8% of all components of blood processed for transfusion were outdated in 2004 in the USA (AABB 2005).

PY  - 2002///
AB  - Advances in e-commerce have resulted in significant progress towards strategies, requirements, and development of e-commerce applications. However, nearly all e-commerce applications envisioned and developed so far assume fixed or stationary users with wired infrastructure. We envision many new e-commerce applications that will be possible and significantly benefit from emerging wireless and mobile networks. To allow designers, developers, and researchers to strategize and create mobile commerce applications, we propose a four-level integrated framework for mobile commerce. Since there are potentially an unlimited number of mobile commerce applications, we attempt to identify several important classes of applications such as mobile financial applications, mobile inventory management, proactive service management, product location and search, and wireless re-engineering. We discuss how to successfully define, architect, and implement the necessary hardware/software infrastructure in support of mobile commerce. Also, to make mobile commerce applications a reality, we address networking requirements, discuss support from wireless carriers, and present some open research problems.

DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.2016.2479
PY  - 2017///
AB  - We study the effects of the introduction of cross-channel functionalities on the overall sales dispersion of retailers and the implications of these effects for inventory management. To do that, we analyze data from a leading U.S. retailer who introduced a “ship-to-store” (STS) functionality that allows customers to ship products to their local store free of charge when those products are not available in their local store. Based on the fact that stores prioritize carrying products for which local demand is high, we test the hypothesis that introducing the STS functionality increased the retailer’s overall sales dispersion. We find that, on average, the contribution of the 90% lowest-selling products to total sales increased by 0.75 percentage points, increasing sales dispersion. Calibrating conventional inventory-ordering models, we show that to respond optimally to the observed increase in dispersion, the retailer would need to increase its cycle and safety inventories by approximately 2.7%.

TI  - Triangulating Principal Effectiveness

PY  - 2011///
AB  - While the importance of effective principals is undisputed, few studies have identified specific skills that principals need to promote school success. This study draws on unique data combining survey responses from principals, assistant principals, teachers, and parents with rich administrative data to determine which principal skills correlate most highly with school outcomes. Factor analysis of a 42-item task inventory distinguishes five skill categories, yet only one of them, the principals’ Organization Management skills, consistently predicts student achievement growth and other success measures. Analysis of evaluations of principals by assistant principals supports this central result. The analysis argues for a broad view of principal leadership that includes organizational management skills as a key complement to the work of supporting curriculum and instruction.

TI  - Manufacturer Benefits from Information Integration with Retail Customers
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.1030.0182
PY  - 2004///
AB  - Information integration efforts between manufacturers and retailers, in the form of information sharing, synchronized replenishment, and collaborative product design and development, have been cited as major means to improve supply chain performance. This paper develops a conceptual framework that relates information-integration initiatives to manufacturer profitability. The framework allows such initiatives to impact inventory management and revenue-enhancing measures that, in turn, increase manufacturer profit margins, or affect profit margins directly. Through an extensive survey in the food and consumer packaged goods industry, we empirically examine this framework. The analysis reveals that the various integration techniques are differentially associated with manufacturer performance. Collaborative planning on replenishment, in the form of vendor-managed inventory (VMI), is directly and positively related to manufacturer margins, while collaboration on new products and services is positively related to intermediate performance measures. Specifically, this latter form of collaboration allows the manufacturer to charge higher wholesale prices and, interestingly, is associated with lower retailer, and consequently manufacturer, stockouts. In contrast, collaboration on the handling of excess and defective retailer inventory (i.e., reverse logistics) results in higher manufacturer stockout levels, on average. Solely sharing information on either inventory levels or customer needs is associated with higher manufacturer performance measures up to a certain point; sharing this information is prevalent among manufacturers that achieve industry-average profitability relative to those that achieve below industry-average profitability. The paper explains these results in the context of the conceptual framework developed and discusses the managerial implications for effective coordination between supply chain partners.

PY  - 2001///
AB  - This article concerns leadership effectiveness studied from the reverse angle. We review the literature on managerial derailment and propose a taxonomy of derailment factors. We then describe an inventory designed to assess these factors, provide some evidence regarding the psychometric features of the inventory, and some evidence regarding its validity. We suggest that the base rate for managerial incompetence in any organization is quite high, and we propose our inventory is a useful device for management development – because it focuses on dysfunctional dispositions known to be associated with failure as a manager.

TI  - Canopy closure estimates with GreenOrbs: sustainable sensing in the forest
DO  - 10.1145/1644038.1644049
PY  - 2009///
AB  - Motivated by the needs of precise forest inventory and real-time surveillance for ecosystem management, in this paper we present GreenOrbs [2], a wireless sensor network system and its application for canopy closure estimates. Both the hardware and software designs of GreenOrbs are tailored for sensing in wild environments without human supervision, including a firm weatherproof enclosure of sensor motes and a light-weight mechanism for node state monitoring and data collection. By incorporating a pre-deployment training process as well as a distributed calibration method, the estimates of canopy closure stay accurate and consistent against uncertain sensory data and dynamic environments. We have implemented a prototype system of GreenOrbs and carried out multiple rounds of deployments. The evaluation results demonstrate that GreenOrbs outperforms the conventional approaches for canopy closure estimates. Some early experiences are reported in this paper.

PY  - 2018///
AB  - Normally, items waiting to be purchased or purchase are considered to be in inventory. One of the most pressing problems in the manufacturing and use of goods is the control of this inventory. Many companies experience financial difficulties each year due to a lack of adequate control in this area. Whether it is raw material used to manufacture a product or products waiting to be purchase, problems arise when too many or too few items are available. INTRODUCTION The basic decisions to be made once a source has been determined are how much to order and when to order. Inherent in this analysis is the concept of demand. Demand can be known or unknown, probabilistic or deterministic, constant or lumpy. Each of these characteristics affects the method of approaching the inventory problem. For the unknown demand case a decision must be made as to how much the firm is willing to risk. Normally, the decision would be to produce some k units for use and then determine after some period of time to produce more or to discontinue production due to insufficient demand. This amounts to the reduction of the unknown demand situation to one of a lumpy demand case after the decision has been made to produce the batch of a finite size. Similarly, if a decision is made to begin production at a rate of n per day until further notice, the unknown demand situation has been changed to a constant known demand case. Lumpy demand, or demand that occurs periodically with quantities varying, is frequently encountered in manufacturing and distribution operations. It is distinguished from the known demand case. This second case is that of a product which has historic data from which forecasts of demand can be prepared. A factor of concern in these situations is the lead time and the unit requirement on a periodic basis. The following are the major factors to be considered in the modeling of the inventory situation. Demand is the primary stimulus on the procurement and inventory system and it is the justification for its existence. Specifically the system may exist to meet the demand of customers, the spare parts demand of an operational weapons system, the demand of the next step in a manufacturing process, etc. The characteristic of demand, although independent of the source chosen to replenish inventories, will depend on the nature of the environment giving rise to the demand. The simplest demand pattern may be classified as deterministic. In this special case, the future demand for an item may be predicted with certainty. Demand considered in this restricted sense is only an approximation of reality. In the general case, demand may be described as a random variable that takes on values in accordance with a specific probability distribution. Procurement quantity is the order quantity, which in effect determines the frequency of ordering and is related directly to the maximum inventory level. Maximum shortage is also related to the inventory level. TYPES OF INVENTORY MODELS Deterministic models assume that quantities used in the determination of relationships for the model are all known. These quantities are such things as demand per unit of time, lead time for product arrival, and costs associated with such occurrences as a product shortage, the cost of holding the product in inventory, and that cost associated with placing an order for product. Constant demand is one case that can be analyzed within the category of deterministic models. It represents very effectively the case for some components or parts in an inventory which are used in multiple parents, these multiple parent components having a composite demand which is fairly constant over time. RESEARCH OBJECTIVE 1. Develop a framework for inventory management 2. Classify the inventory 3. Provide a demand forecasting method International Journal of Enhanced Research in Science Technology & Engineering, ISSN: 2319-7463 Vol. 3 Issue 6, June-2014, pp: (456-459), Impact Factor: 1.252, Available online at: www.erpublications.com Page | 457 SCOPE OF STUDY The research is carried out by analyzing one year of data provided by workshop. The model of bus that has been considered in this research is Mod 1, Mod 2, Mod 3, And Mod 4. Fig 1 shows the compiled yearly data for part 01, front glass. The demand data will be modeled and analyzed and the demand for part 01 shall be forecasted for first month of next year. A quick analysis of the forecasted data shows that the demand trend for part 01 is increasing. This could be due to the buses start running many year ago being returned to workshop for repair. In chapter 3, the research will interpret the demand patterns and chapter 4 will show the inventory policies for such phenomenon.

TI  - Management of behavioral problems in Alzheimer's disease
DO  - 10.1017/S1041610209991505
PY  - 2010///
AB  - ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex progressive brain degenerative disorder that has effects on multiple cerebral systems. In addition to cognitive and functional decline, diverse behavioral changes manifest with increasing severity over time, presenting significant management challenges for caregivers and health care professionals. Almost all patients with AD are affected by neuropsychiatric symptoms at some point during their illness; in some cases, symptoms occur prior to diagnosis of the dementia syndrome. Further, behavioral factors have been identified, which may have their origins in particular neurobiological processes, and respond to particular management strategies. Improved clarification of causes, triggers, and presentation of neuropsychiatric symptoms will guide both research and clinical decision-making. Measurement of neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD is most commonly by means of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory; its utility and future development are discussed, as are the limitations and difficulties encountered when quantifying behavioral responses in clinical trials. Evidence from clinical trials of both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments, and from neurobiological studies, provides a range of management options that can be tailored to individual needs. We suggest that non-pharmacological interventions (including psychosocial/psychological counseling, interpersonal management and environmental management) should be attempted first, followed by the least harmful medication for the shortest time possible. Pharmacological treatment options, such as antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, need careful consideration of the benefits and limitations of each drug class.

PY  - 2001///
AB  - We find that the negative relation between accruals and future abnormal returns documented by Sloan (1996) is due mainly to inventory changes. We propose three explanations for this result, derived from the prior literature, but find evidence inconsistent with all three explanations. To assist future investigations in formulating additional explanations, we document several empirical regularities for extreme inventory change deciles. We speculate that demand shifts explain our results, and examine the feasibility of alternative reasons for the stock market's apparent inability to recognize the impending profitability reversals. Our evidence is consistent with earnings management masking the implications of demand shifts.

TI  - A Multiproduct Dynamic Pricing Problem and Its Applications to Network Yield Management
DO  - 10.1287/opre.45.1.24
PY  - 1997///
AB  - A firm has inventories of a set of components that are used to produce a set of products. There is a finite horizon over which the firm can sell its products. Demand for each product is a stochastic point process with an intensity that is a function of the vector of prices for the products and the time at which these prices are offered. The problem is to price the finished products so as to maximize total expected revenue over the finite sales horizon. An upper bound on the optimal expected revenue is established by analyzing a deterministic version of the problem. The solution to the deterministic problem suggests two heuristics for the stochastic problem that are shown to be asymptotically optimal as the expected sales volume tends to infinity. Several applications of the model to network yield management are given. Numerical examples illustrate both the range of problems that can be modeled under this framework and the effectiveness of the proposed heuristics. The results provide several fundamental insights into the performance of yield management systems.

AB  - Canada’s National Forest Inventory (NFI) sampling program is designed to support reporting on forests at the national scale. On the other hand, continuous maps of forest attributes are required to support strategic analyses of regional policy and management issues. We have therefore produced maps covering 4.03 × 106 km2 of inventoried forest area for the 2001 base year using standardised observations from the NFI photo plots (PP) as reference data. We used the k nearest neighbours (kNN) method with 26 geospatial data layers including MODIS spectral data and climatic and topographic variables to produce maps of 127 forest attributes at a 250 × 250 m resolution. The stand-level attributes include land cover, structure, and tree species relative abundance. In this article, we report only on total live aboveground tree biomass, with all other attributes covered in the supplementary data (http://nrcresearchpress.com/doi/suppl/10.1139/cjfr-2013-0401).

AB  - Digital Equipment Corporation evaluates global supply chain alternatives and determines worldwide manufacturing and distribution strategy, using the Global Supply Chain Model (GSCM) which recommends a production, distribution, and vendor network. GSCM minimizes cost or weighted cumulative production and distribution times or both subject to meeting estimated demand and restrictions on local content, offset trade, and joint capacity for multiple products, echelons, and time periods. Cost factors include fixed and variable production charges, inventory charges, distribution expenses via multiple modes, taxes, duties, and duty drawback. GSCM is a large mixed-integer linear program that incorporates a global, multi-product bill of materials for supply chains with arbitrary echelon structure and a comprehensive model of integrated global manufacturing and distribution decisions. The supply chain restructuring has saved over $100 million (US).

TI  - Coordinating Inventory Control and Pricing Strategies for Perishable Products
DO  - 10.1287/opre.2014.1261
PY  - 2014///
AB  - We analyze a joint pricing and inventory control problem for a perishable product with a fixed lifetime over a finite horizon. In each period, demand depends on the price of the current period plus an additive random term. Inventories can be intentionally disposed of, and those that reach their lifetime have to be disposed of. The objective is to find a joint pricing, ordering, and disposal policy to maximize the total expected discounted profit over the planning horizon taking into account linear ordering cost, inventory holding and backlogging or lost-sales penalty cost, and disposal cost. Employing the concept of L♮-concavity, we show some monotonicity properties of the optimal policies. Our results shed new light on perishable inventory management, and our approach provides a significantly simpler proof of a classical structural result in the literature. Moreover, we identify bounds on the optimal order-up-to levels and develop an effective heuristic policy. Numerical results show that our heuristic policy performs well in both stationary and nonstationary settings. Finally, we show that our approach also applies to models with random lifetimes and inventory rationing models with multiple demand classes.

DO  - 10.2307/2491429
PY  - 1996///
AB  - This paper provides evidence on the causes and shareholder wealth effects of discretionary asset write-offs. We use the term "write-off" to refer to both complete and partial downward asset revaluations, and we describe our sample write-offs as discretionary because over the 1989-92 period covered by the study, there was little authoritative guidance on the accounting for most types of asset impairments, other than inventory. The absence of explicit guidance for many assets permitted substantial management discretion about amounts and timing of write-offs. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants urged the Financial Accounting Standards Board in 1980 to examine the asset impairment issue because they believed that the variety of practices, terminology, and valuation methods in use reduced the comparability and consistency of financial statements. These concerns, echoed by the Emerging Issues Task Force, the Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Committee, the Financial Executives Institute, and the National Association of Accoun-

TI  - Do Managers Always Know Better? Relative Accuracy of Management and Analyst Forecasts
DO  - 10.1111/J.1475-679X.2012.00461.X
PY  - 2012///
AB  - We examine the relative accuracy of management and analyst forecasts of annual EPS. We predict and find that analysts’ information advantage resides at the macroeconomic level. They provide more accurate earnings forecasts than management when a firm's fortunes move in concert with macroeconomic factors such as Gross Domestic Product and energy costs. In contrast, we predict and find that management's information advantage resides at the firm level. Their forecasts are more accurate than analysts’ when management's actions, which affect reported earnings, are difficult to anticipate by outsiders, such as when the firm's inventories are abnormally high or the firm has excess capacity or is experiencing a loss. Although analysts are commonly viewed as industry specialists, we fail to find evidence that analysts have an information advantage over managers at the industry level. The two have comparable abilities to forecast earnings for firms with revenues or earnings that are more synchronous with their industries.

DO  - 10.1007/s12371-015-0153-0
PY  - 2016///
AB  - Due to the renewed interest for sites of geological interest, both in nature conservation and tourist sectors, numerous regional and national geosite inventories have been carried out in several countries during the last two decades. Several research groups discussed methodological issues, in particular concerning the assessment, and proposed various assessment methods. The University of Lausanne developed a method for assessing the scientific and additional values of geomorphosites in 2007. The method was widely used in regional inventories in Switzerland and abroad. This paper presents a new version of the method and discusses four main issues: (1) the assessment methodology is included in a larger process, from the selection of potential geomorphosites to their use and evaluation by stakeholders; (2) a particular attention is put on the selection of potential geomorphosites that will then be assessed and a simple approach crossing a spatial selection (the selected geomorphosites should be representative of the regional geomorphological processes) and a temporal one (the selected geomorphosites should cover the whole temporal stages of the regional morphogenesis, with both relict and active landforms) is proposed; (3) a new part is added in the assessment method; it concerns the use characteristics and fills a gap in the existing method; (4) finally, the paper discusses mapping and representation issues: specific maps are produced at two levels: simple geomorphological maps accompany the assessment of each geomorphosite and synthetic maps, covering the whole study area, are produced for the communication of results to stakeholders. For this, four types of representation (qualitative, univariate, bivariate, multivariate) are proposed. The method is illustrated by three examples of inventories carried out in Western Switzerland and Haute-Savoie (France).

TI  - Optimal inventory management of a bike-sharing station
DO  - 10.1080/0740817X.2013.770186
PY  - 2013///
AB  - Bike-sharing systems allow people to rent a bicycle at one of many automatic rental stations scattered around a city, use them for a short journey, and return them at any other station in that city. A crucial factor in the success of such a system is its ability to meet the fluctuating demand for both bicycles and vacant lockers at each station. In order to meet the demand, the inventory of each station must be reviewed regularly. This article introduces an inventory model suited for the management of bike rental stations and a numerical solution method used to solve it. Moreover, a structural result about the convexity of the model is proved. The method may be applicable for other closed-loop inventory systems. An extensive numerical study based on real-life data is presented to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.

DO  - 10.1111/J.1745-493X.2003.TB00156.X
PY  - 2003///
AB  - SUMMARY Managing supply risk is an essential element of the overall supply management task. As the complexity of risk management has increased, responsiveness seems dominated by varying the level of inventory and using multiple supply sources as means of creating buffers. This research uses the framework of agency theory in managing supplier behaviors as a means to reduce supply risk and the impact of detrimental events. Empirical results indicate that purchasing organizations address various sources of supply risk by implementing management techniques that reduce the likelihood that detrimental events will occur. Firm size, purchases as a percentage of sales, and industry characteristics were also found to influence the manner in which supplier behaviors are managed.

TI  - The pros and cons of RFID in supply chain management
DO  - 10.1109/ICMB.2005.103
PY  - 2005///
AB  - This paper presents the pros and cons of using radio-frequency identification (RFID) in supply chain management (SCM). While RFID has a greater number of benefits than its predecessor, the bar code, it currently comes at a price that many businesses still consider prohibitive. On the one hand, RFID is advantageous because it does not require line-of-sight scanning, it acts to reduce labor levels, enhances visibility, and improves inventory management. On the other hand, RFID is presently a costly solution, lacking standardization, it has a small number of suppliers developing end-to-end solutions, suffers from some adverse deployment issues, and is clouded by privacy concerns. Irrespective of these factors, the ultimate aim of RFID in SCM is to see the establishment of item-level tracking which should act to revolutionize SCM practices, introducing another level of efficiencies never before seen.

DO  - 10.1287/INTE.22.1.8
PY  - 1992///
AB  - Critical to an airline's operation is the effective use of its reservations inventory. American Airlines began research in the early 1960s in managing revenue from this inventory. Because of the problem's size and difficulty, American Airlines Decision Technologies has developed a series of OR models that effectively reduce the large problem to three much smaller and far more manageable subproblems: overbooking, discount allocation, and traffic management. The results of the subproblem solutions are combined to determine the final inventory levels. American Airlines estimates the quantifiable benefit at $1.4 billion over the last three years and expects an annual revenue contribution of over $500 million to continue into the future.

TI  - Does Ineffective Internal Control over Financial Reporting Affect a Firm’s Operations? Evidence from Firms’ Inventory Management
DO  - 10.2139/ssrn.2187599
PY  - 2014///
AB  - We investigate whether ineffective internal control over financial reporting has implications for firm operations by examining the association between inventory-related material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and firms’ inventory management. We find that firms with inventory-related material weaknesses have systematically lower inventory turnover ratios and are more likely to report inventory impairments relative to firms with effective internal control over financial reporting. We also find that inventory turnover rates increase for firms that remediate material weaknesses related to inventory tracking. Remediating firms also experience increases in sales, gross profit and operating cash flows. Finally, we assess the generalizability of our findings by examining all material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, regardless of type, and provide evidence that firms’ return-on-assets are associated with both their existence and remediation. Collectively, our findings support the general hypothesis that internal control over financial reporting has an economically significant effect on firm operations.

AB  - A seller wishes to sell multiple goods by a deadline, for example, the end of a season. Potential buyers enter over time and can strategically time their purchases. Each period, the profit-maximizing mechanism awards units to the buyers with the highest valuations exceeding a sequence of cutoffs. We show that these cutoffs are deterministic, depending only on the inventory and time remaining; in the continuous-time limit, the optimal mechanism can be implemented by posting anonymous prices. When incoming demand decreases over time, the optimal cutoffs satisfy a one-period-look-ahead property and prices are defined by an intuitive differential equation.

TI  - The role of LiDAR in sustainable forest management
DO  - 10.5558/TFC84807-6
PY  - 2008///
AB  - Forest characterization with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data has recently garnered much scientific and operational attention. The number of forest inventory attributes that may be directly measured with LiDAR is limited; however, when considered within the context of all the measured and derived attributes required to complete a forest inventory, LiDAR can be a valuable tool in the inventory process. In this paper, we present the status of LiDAR remote sensing of forests, including issues related to instrumentation, data collection, data processing, costs, and attribute estimation. The information needs of sustainable forest management provide the context within which we consider future opportunities for LiDAR and automated data processing.

TI  - Age structure and disturbance legacy of North American forests
DO  - 10.5194/BG-8-715-2011
PY  - 2010///
AB  - Abstract. Most forests of the world are recovering from a past disturbance. It is well known that forest disturbances profoundly affect carbon stocks and fluxes in forest ecosystems, yet it has been a great challenge to assess disturbance impacts in estimates of forest carbon budgets. Net sequestration or loss of CO2 by forests after disturbance follows a predictable pattern with forest recovery. Forest age, which is related to time since disturbance, is a useful surrogate variable for analyses of the impact of disturbance on forest carbon. In this study, we compiled the first continental forest age map of North America by combining forest inventory data, historical fire data, optical satellite data and the dataset from NASA's Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) project. A companion map of the standard deviations for age estimates was developed for quantifying uncertainty. We discuss the significance of the disturbance legacy from the past, as represented by current forest age structure in different regions of the US and Canada, by analyzing the causes of disturbances from land management and nature over centuries and at various scales. We also show how such information can be used with inventory data for analyzing carbon management opportunities. By combining geographic information about forest age with estimated C dynamics by forest type, it is possible to conduct a simple but powerful analysis of the net CO2 uptake by forests, and the potential for increasing (or decreasing) this rate as a result of direct human intervention in the disturbance/age status. Finally, we describe how the forest age data can be used in large-scale carbon modeling, both for land-based biogeochemistry models and atmosphere-based inversion models, in order to improve the spatial accuracy of carbon cycle simulations.

DO  - 10.1080/01431161.2010.494184
PY  - 2011///
AB  - Efficient forest management demands detailed, timely information. As high spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery becomes more available, there is a great potential for conducting high accuracy forest inventory and analysis automatically and cost-efficiently. Recent research aimed at providing tree-based forest inventory measurements has generated numerous algorithms for automatic individual tree-crown detection and delineation. This article reviews this research with a focus on algorithms applied to passive remote-sensing imagery. The article categorizes and evaluates methods for automatic tree-crown detection and delineation. It considers the types of imagery and the characteristics of the study areas these algorithms are applied to and evaluates the influence of these factors on the methods. The article also reviews and evaluates quantitative accuracy assessment methods for tree-crown delineation and detection. Finally, the article summarizes the commonalities of current algorithms, and the new development that can be expected in the future.

TI  - Anger and Sadness Regulation: Predictions to Internalizing and Externalizing Symptoms in Children
DO  - 10.1207/S15374424JCCP3103_11
PY  - 2002///
AB  - Examined the relation between children's self-reported anger and sadness regulation and the presence of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Participants were 121 boys and 106 girls in the fourth and fifth grades who completed the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), Emotion Expression Scale for Children (EESC), and Children's Emotion Management Scales (CSMS, CAMS) and rated each other on aggressive behavior. Results of multiple regression analyses indicated that the inability to identify emotional states, the inhibition of anger, the dysregulation of anger and sadness, and the constructive coping with anger predicted internalizing symptoms. The dysregulated expression of sadness and constructive coping with anger were inversely related to externalizing symptoms.

TI  - A global inventory of nitric oxide emissions from soils
DO  - 10.1023/A:1009738715891
PY  - 2004///
AB  - Over 60 published papers reporting field measurements of emissions of nitric oxide (NO) from soil are reviewed, and over 100 annual estimates of NO emissions were made for various types of ecosystems, including agricultural fields. These data were stratified by biome and the mean of each stratum was multiplied by an estimate of the biome area. A few strata were identified as clearly having low NO emissions: montane forests, swamps and marshes, tundra, and temperate forests that are not heavily affected by N deposition. The largest emissions were observed in tropical savanna/woodland, chaparral, and cultivated agriculture, but variation in NO emissions within these strata was also large. Although the stratification scheme fails to partition this within-stratum variation, it does clearly identify these biomes as globally important sources of NO and as areas where more research is needed to investigate within-biome variation in NO emissions. It is too early to tell whether differences in NO emissions between temperate and tropical agriculture are significant, but it is clear that agriculture is an important source of NO and that management practices affect NO emissions. The best current estimate of the global soil source of NO is 21 Tg N yr-1. Adsorption of NOx onto plant canopy surfaces may reduce emissions to the atmosphere to as low as 13 Tg N yr-1, although the absorption effect is probably smaller than this. An error term for the global estimate is difficult to determine, but it is at least ±4 and perhaps as large at ±10 Tg N yr-1. Hence, only modest progress has been made in narrowing uncertainties in the estimate of the global soil source of NO, although some published lower estimates appear unlikely. This inventory reconfirms that the soil source of NO is similar in magnitude to fossil fuel emissions of NOx. Further narrowing of the uncertainty of the estimate of global soil NO emissions will require more sophisticated and carefully chosen stratification schemes to address variation within biomes based on soil fertility, soil texture, climate, and management and will require linking this type of inventory and stratification with mechanistic models.

TI  - An Econometric Analysis of Inventory Turnover Performance in Retail Services
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.1040.0298
PY  - 2005///
AB  - Inventory turnover varies widely across retailers and over time. This variation undermines the usefulness of inventory turnover in performance analysis, benchmarking, and working capital management. We develop an empirical model using financial data for 311 publicly listed retail firms for the years 1987-2000 to investigate the correlation of inventory turnover with gross margin, capital intensity, and sales surprise (the ratio of actual sales to expected sales for the year). The model explains 66.7% of the within-firm variation and 97.2% of the total variation (across and within firms) in inventory turnover. It yields an alternative metric of inventory productivity, adjusted inventory turnover, which empirically adjusts inventory turnover for changes in gross margin, capital intensity, and sales surprise, and can be applied in performance analysis and managerial decision making. We also compute time trends in inventory turnover and adjusted inventory turnover, and find that both have declined in retailing during the 1987-2000 period.

TI  - Remote sensing and forest inventories in Nordic countries – roadmap for the future
DO  - 10.1080/02827581.2017.1416666
PY  - 2018///
AB  - ABSTRACT The Nordic countries have long traditions in forest inventory and remote sensing (RS). In sample-based national forest inventories (NFIs), utilization of aerial photographs started during the 1960s, satellite images during the 1980s, laser scanning during the 2000s, and photogrammetric point clouds during the 2010s. In forest management inventories (FMI), utilization of aerial photos started during the 1940s and laser scanning during the 2000s. However, so far, RS has mostly been used for map production and research rather than for estimation of regional parameters or inference on their accuracy. In recent years, the RS technology has been developing very fast. At the same time, the needs for information are constantly increasing. New technologies have created possibilities for cost-efficient production of accurate, large area forest data sets, which also will change the way forest inventories are done in the future. In this study, we analyse the state-of-the-art both in the NFIs and FMIs in the Nordic countries. We identify the benefits and drawbacks of different RS materials and data acquisition approaches with different user perspectives. Based on the analysis, we identify the needs for further development and emerging research questions. We also discuss alternatives for ownership of the data and cost-sharing between different actors in the field.

DO  - 10.1287/opre.51.2.329.12788
PY  - 2003///
AB  - A standard problem in operations literature is optimal stocking of substitutable products. We consider a very general consumer-driven substitution problem with an arbitrary number of products and a quite general substitution structure, both under centralized inventory management and competition. We obtain analytically tractable solutions that generalize and extend the results of several earlier papers in this area and also lead to new results.

TI  - Can Financial Innovation Help to Explain the Reduced Volatility of Economic Activity?
DO  - 10.2139/ssrn.873871
PY  - 2005///
AB  - The stabilization of economic activity in the mid 1980s has received considerable attention. Research has focused primarily on the role played by milder economic shocks, improved inventory management, and better monetary policy. This paper explores another potential explanation: financial innovation. Examples of such innovation include developments in lending practices and loan markets that have enhanced the ability of households and firms to borrow and changes in government policy such as the demise of Regulation Q. We employ a variety of simple empirical techniques to identify links between the observed moderation in economic activity and the influence of financial innovation on consumer spending, housing investment, and business fixed investment. Our results suggest that financial innovation should be added to the list of likely contributors to the mid-1980s stabilization.

TI  - Effect of Working Capital Management on Firm Profitability
DO  - 10.1177/097215091001200110
PY  - 2011///
AB  - The main aim of this article is to examine the effect of working capital on profitability of Indian firms. We collected data about a sample of 263 non-financial BSE 500 firms listed at the Bombay Stock (BSE) from 2000 to 2008 and evaluated the data using OLS multiple regression. The findings of our study significantly depart from the various international studies conducted in different markets. The results reveal that working capital management and profitability is positively correlated in Indian companies. The study further reveals that inventory of number of days and number of days accounts payable are negatively correlated with a firm’s profitability, whereas number of days accounts receivables and cash conversion period exhibit a positive relationship with corporate profitability. The present study contributes to the existing literature by examining the effect of working capital management on profitability in the context of an emerging capital market such as India.

TI  - Risk Aversion in Inventory Management
DO  - 10.1287/opre.1070.0429
PY  - 2007///
AB  - Traditional inventory models focus on risk-neutral decision makers, i.e., characterizing replenishment strategies that maximize expected total profit, or equivalently, minimize expected total cost over a planning horizon. In this paper, we propose a framework for incorporating risk aversion in multiperiod inventory models as well as multiperiod models that coordinate inventory and pricing strategies. We show that the structure of the optimal policy for a decision maker with exponential utility functions is almost identical to the structure of the optimal risk-neutral inventory (and pricing) policies. These structural results are extended to models in which the decision maker has access to a (partially) complete financial market and can hedge its operational risk through trading financial securities. Computational results demonstrate that the optimal policy is relatively insensitive to small changes in the decision-maker's level of risk aversion.

DO  - 10.1093/ROF/RFS043
PY  - 2013///
AB  - We provide the first empirical study of the relationship between corporate working capital management and shareholders' wealth. Examining US corporations from 1990 through 2006, we find evidence that: the incremental dollar invested in net operating working capital is worth less than the incremental dollar held in cash for the average firm; the valuation of the incremental dollar invested in net operating working capital is significantly influenced by a firm's future sales expectations, its debt load, its financial constraints, and its bankruptcy risk; and the value of the incremental dollar extended in credit to one's customers has a greater effect on shareholders' wealth than the incremental dollar invested in inventories for the average firm.

TI  - Opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in tropical peatlands
DO  - 10.1073/pnas.0911966107
PY  - 2010///
AB  - The upcoming global mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries should include and prioritize tropical peatlands. Forested tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia are rapidly being converted into production systems by introducing perennial crops for lucrative agribusiness, such as oil-palm and pulpwood plantations, causing large greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for GHG Inventory on Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Uses provide an adequate framework for emissions inventories in these ecosystems; however, specific emission factors are needed for more accurate and cost-effective monitoring. The emissions are governed by complex biophysical processes, such as peat decomposition and compaction, nutrient availability, soil water content, and water table level, all of which are affected by management practices. We estimate that total carbon loss from converting peat swamp forests into oil palm is 59.4 ± 10.2 Mg of CO2 per hectare per year during the first 25 y after land-use cover change, of which 61.6% arise from the peat. Of the total amount (1,486 ± 183 Mg of CO2 per hectare over 25 y), 25% are released immediately from land-clearing fire. In order to maintain high palm-oil production, nitrogen inputs through fertilizer are needed and the magnitude of the resulting increased N2O emissions compared to CO2 losses remains unclear.

TI  - Inventory of the non‐native flora of Italy
DO  - 10.1080/11263500902722824
PY  - 2009///
AB  - Abstract In this paper we present a comprehensive inventory of the non‐native vascular flora of Italy, which was produced within the project “A survey of the Italian non‐native flora”, funded by the Italian Ministry for the Environment. Previously published floristic accounts were the main source of information. Historical records were critically revised and integrated with recent literature, data from herbaria and some unpublished information, so as to obtain a complete, up‐to‐date catalogue of the non‐native vascular plant species that occur spontaneously in Italy. The inventory lists 1023 non‐native species and subspecies, which account for 13.4% of all the Italian flora. The Italian non‐native flora was divided, according to its residence time, into 103 archaeophytes and 920 neophytes. According to its current invasion status, it was classified into 437 casual (42.7% of all non‐native) and 524 established taxa, the latter being divided into 361 naturalized non‐invasive (35.3%) and 163 invasive taxa (15.9%). The inventory includes a group of 62 species (6.1%) that lack recent records (i.e. since 1950). By combining local expertise into a unified, nationwide scheme using a standardized method and terminology, the inventory provides the essential scientific basis for the development of plant invasion research and management in the country.

TI  - The Proactive Coping Inventory ( PCI ) : A Multidimensional Research Instrument
PY  - 2014///
AB  - The present paper introduces a new psychometric tool, the Proactive Coping Inventory (PCI), which takes a multidimensional approach to coping. A distinction between self-regulatory threat appraisal and self-regulatory goal attainment is made to account for a positive facet of coping, namely setting of, and striving for goals. It goes beyond traditional risk management when people face a threat and attempt to build up their resistance resources well ahead of time. Rather, proactive coping integrates processes of personal quality of life management with those of selfregulatory goal attainment as illustrated by the prototypical lives of entrepreneurs, scientists, artists, teachers, or missionaries, for example. The PCI is distinguished by three main features: (a) It integrates planning and preventive strategies with proactive self-regulatory goal attainment; (b) It integrates proactive goal attainment with identification and utilization of social resources, and (c) It utilizes proactive emotional coping for self-regulatory goal attainment. A large pool of test items was generated and administered to samples of Canadian and Polish-Canadian respondents. Scale reduction techniques were used to derive the seven scales (based on 55 items) that constitute the Proactive Coping Inventory (PCI). Results reported indicated that the scales possess good reliability and validity.

TI  - Unraveling the Differential Effects of Motivational and Skills, Social, and Self-Management Measures from Traditional Predictors of College Outcomes.
DO  - 10.1037/0022-0663.98.3.598
PY  - 2006///
AB  - The authors report on a large-scale study examining the effects of self-reported psychosocial factors on 1st-year college outcomes. Using a sample of 14,464 students from 48 institutions, the authors constructed hierarchical regression models to measure the predictive validity of the Student Readiness Inventory, a measure of psychosocial factors. Controlling for institutional effects and traditional predictors, the authors tested the effects of motivational and skill, social, and self-management measures on academic performance and retention. Academic Discipline was incrementally predictive of academic performance (grade-point average) and retention. Social Activity and Emotional Control also helped predict academic performance and retention, whereas Commitment to College and Social Connection offered incremental prediction of retention. This study elaborates recent meta-analytic findings (S. Robbins et al., 2004), demonstrating the salience of a subset of motivational, social, and self-management factors. Future research questions include how measures of psychosocial factors can be used to aid students, the salience of these measures over the entire college experience and for predicting job performance, and the need for testing theoretical models for explaining postsecondary educational outcomes incorporating traditional, motivational, self-management, and social engagement factors.

TI  - High-resolution mapping of vehicle emissions in China in 2008
DO  - 10.5194/ACP-14-9787-2014
PY  - 2014///
AB  - Abstract. This study is the first in a series of papers that aim to develop high-resolution emission databases for different anthropogenic sources in China. Here we focus on on-road transportation. Because of the increasing impact of on-road transportation on regional air quality, developing an accurate and high-resolution vehicle emission inventory is important for both the research community and air quality management. This work proposes a new inventory methodology to improve the spatial and temporal accuracy and resolution of vehicle emissions in China. We calculate, for the first time, the monthly vehicle emissions for 2008 in 2364 counties (an administrative unit one level lower than city) by developing a set of approaches to estimate vehicle stock and monthly emission factors at county-level, and technology distribution at provincial level. We then introduce allocation weights for the vehicle kilometers traveled to assign the county-level emissions onto 0.05° × 0.05° grids based on the China Digital Road-network Map (CDRM). The new methodology overcomes the common shortcomings of previous inventory methods, including neglecting the geographical differences between key parameters and using surrogates that are weakly related to vehicle activities to allocate vehicle emissions. The new method has great advantages over previous methods in depicting the spatial distribution characteristics of vehicle activities and emissions. This work provides a better understanding of the spatial representation of vehicle emissions in China and can benefit both air quality modeling and management with improved spatial accuracy.

TI  - WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND CORPORATE PERFORMANCE OF MANUFACTURING SECTOR IN PAKISTAN
PY  - 2010///
AB  - Working capital management plays a significant role in better performance of manufacturing firms. This paper analyzes the impact of working capital management on firm’s performance in Pakistan for the period 1998 to 2007. For this purpose, balanced panel data of 204 manufacturing firms is used which are listed on Karachi Stock Exchange. The results indicate that the cash conversion cycle, net trade cycle and inventory turnover in days are significantly affecting the performance of the firms. The manufacturing firms are in general facing problems with their collection and payment policies. Moreover, the financial leverage, sales growth and firm size also have significant effect on the firm’s profitability. The study also concludes that firms in Pakistan are following conservative working capital management policy and the firms are needed to concentrate and improve their collection and payment policy. The effective policies must be formulated for the individual components of working capital. Furthermore, efficient Management and financing of working capital (current assets and current liabilities) can increase the operating profitability of manufacturing firms. For efficient working capital management, specialized persons in the fields of finance should be hired by the firms for expert advice on working capital management in the manufacturing sector.

TI  - Mortality rates associated with crown health for eastern forest tree species
DO  - 10.1007/s10661-015-4332-x
PY  - 2015///
AB  - The condition of tree crowns is an important indicator of tree and forest health. Crown conditions have been evaluated during inventories of the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program since 1999. In this study, remeasured data from 55,013 trees on 2616 FIA plots in the eastern USA were used to assess the probability of survival among various tree species using the suite of FIA crown condition variables. Logistic regression procedures were employed to develop models for predicting tree survival. Results of the regression analyses indicated that crown dieback was the most important crown condition variable for predicting tree survival for all species combined and for many of the 15 individual species in the study. The logistic models were generally successful in representing recent tree mortality responses to multiyear infestations of beech bark disease and hemlock woolly adelgid. Although our models are only applicable to trees growing in a forest setting, the utility of models that predict impending tree mortality goes beyond forest inventory or traditional forestry growth and yield models and includes any application where managers need to assess tree health or predict tree mortality including urban forest, recreation, wildlife, and pest management.

DO  - 10.1007/s10530-008-9253-y
PY  - 2009///
AB  - Abstract573 alien marine metazoan species have been recorded in the Mediterranean Sea. The present checklist is the first to present the species’ native range, presumed mode of introduction, spatial extent, and the date of the first record in each country. The majority of aliens are thermophilic species originating from the Indo-Pacific or Indian Oceans, which have entered the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal. However, the means of introduction differ greatly among the phyla, and the basins of the Mediterranean. The temporal records of the alien species reflect political crises, economic development and scientific interest in studying the phenomenon—in the past two decades on average about 10 alien species new to the Mediterranean are recorded annually. Many have established durable populations and extended their range: 125 alien species have been recorded from four or more countries. The possible impacts of regulatory instruments and environmental management options are examined.

DO  - 10.1109/TEM.2012.2189108
PY  - 2012///
AB  - Green and lean paradigms have been adopted by companies in order to manage their relationships with suppliers in a supply chain management context, but nearly always separately and with little understanding of their influence on company performance. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for the analysis of the influence of green and lean upstream supply chain management practices on the sustainable development of businesses. To attend this objective, a set of performance measures covering economic (operational cost, environmental cost, and inventory cost), environmental (business wastage, green image, and CO2 emission), and social (corruption risk, supplier screening and local supplier) perspectives is proposed. An explanatory case study was conducted at a Portuguese automaker to test qualitatively the validity of the proposed theoretical framework. From the case study, a model is suggested, which encompasses the relationships between green and lean upstream supply chain practices and sustainable business development.

DO  - 10.1111/POMS.12295
PY  - 2015///
AB  - Dynamic pricing enables a firm to increase revenue by better matching supply with demand, responding to shifting demand patterns, and achieving customer segmentation. In the last 20 years, numerous success stories of dynamic pricing applications have motivated a rapidly growing research interest in a variety of dynamic pricing problems in the academic literature. A large class of problems that arise in various revenue management applications involve selling a given amount of inventory over a finite time horizon without inventory replenishment. In this study, we identify most recent trends in dynamic pricing research involving such problems. We review existing research on three new classes of problems that have attracted a rapidly growing interest in the last several years, namely, problems with multiple products, problems with competition, and problems with limited demand information. We also identify a number of possible directions for future research.

AB  - This article surveys 100 years of research on career management and retirement, with a primary focus on work published in the Journal of Applied Psychology. Research on career management took off in the 1920s, with most attention devoted to the development and validation of career interest inventories. Over time, research expanded to attend to broader issues such as the predictors and outcomes of career interests and choice; the nature of career success and who achieves it; career transitions and adaptability to change; retirement decision making and adjustment; and bridge employment. In this article, we provide a timeline for the evolution of the career management and retirement literature, review major theoretical perspectives and findings on career management and retirement, and discuss important future research directions.

TI  - Intelligent Predictive Decision Support System for Condition-Based Maintenance
DO  - 10.1007/S001700170173
PY  - 2001///
AB  - The high costs in maintaining today’s complex and sophisticated equipment make it necessary to enhance modern maintenance management systems. Conventional condition-based maintenance (CBM) reduces the uncertainty of maintenance according to the needs indicated by the equipment condition. The intelligent predictive decision support system (IPDSS) for condition-based maintenance (CBM) supplements the conventional CBM approach by adding the capability of intelligent condition-based fault diagnosis and the power of predicting the trend of equipment deterioration. An IPDSS model, based on the recurrent neural network (RNN) approach, was developed and tested and run for the critical equipment of a power plant. The results showed that the IPDSS model provided reliable fault diagnosis and strong predictive power for the trend of equipment deterioration. These valuable results could be used as input to an integrated maintenance management system to pre-plan and pre-schedule maintenance work, to reduce inventory costs for spare parts, to cut down unplanned forced outage and to minimise the risk of catastrophic failure.

TI  - Inventory modelling for complex emergencies in humanitarian relief operations
DO  - 10.1080/13675560500453667
PY  - 2006///
AB  - The increasing complexity and magnitude of global emergency relief operations create a critical need for effective and efficient humanitarian supply chain management processes. The irregular demand patterns and unusual constraints inherent in large-scale emergencies present unique challenges to physical supply systems. Indeed, the logistical needs of non-governmental organisations frequently surpass the capabilities of current emergency response approaches. There is only a limited body of research in humanitarian supply chain management, particularly in the area of inventory control. In this research, this limitation is addressed by developing a stochastic inventory control model that determines optimal order quantities and reorder points for a long-term emergency relief response.

AB  - We address the procurement of new components for recyclable products in the context of Kodak's single-use camera. The objective is to find an ordering policy that minimizes the total expected procurement, inventory holding, and lost sales cost. Distinguishing characteristics of the system are the uncertainty and unobservability associated with return flows of used cameras. We model the system as a closed queueing network, develop a heuristic procedure for adaptive estimation and control, and illustrate our methods with disguised data from Kodak. Using this framework, we investigate the effects of various system characteristics such as informational structure, procurement delay, demand rate, and length of the product's life cycle.

TI  - Management of Multi-Item Retail Inventory Systems with Demand Substitution
DO  - 10.1287/opre.48.1.50.12443
PY  - 2000///
AB  - Customers for retail merchandise can often be satisfied with one of several items. Accounting for demand substitution in defining customer service influences the choice of items to stock and the optimal inventory level for each item stocked. Further, when certain items are not stocked, the resulting substitutions increase the demand for other items, which also affects the optimal stock levels. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic demand model for items in an assortment that captures the effects of substitution and a methodology for selecting item inventory levels so as to maximize total expected profit, subject to given resource constraints. Illustrative examples are solved to provide insights concerning the behavior of the optimal inventory policies, using the negative binomial demand distribution, which has performed well in fitting retail sales data.

DO  - 10.1287/msom.1110.0344
PY  - 2011///
AB  - We consider the problem of pricing multiple differentiated products with the nested logit model and, as a special case, the multinomial logit model. We prove that concavity of the total profit function with respect to market share holds even when price sensitivity may vary with products. We use this result to analytically compare the optimal monopoly solution to oligopolistic equilibrium solutions. To demonstrate further applications of the concavity result, we consider several multiperiod dynamic models that incorporate the pricing of multiple products in the context of inventory control and revenue management, and establish structural results of the optimal policies.

TI  - The Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding Short Form (BIDR-16)
DO  - 10.1177/2158244015621113
PY  - 2015///
AB  - Self-report studies often call for assessment of socially desirable responding. Many researchers use the Marlowe–Crowne Scale for its brief versions; however, this scale is outdated, and contemporary models of social desirability emphasize its multi-dimensional nature. The 40-item Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR) incorporates Self-Deceptive Enhancement (honest but overly positive responding) and Impression Management (bias toward pleasing others). However, its length limits its practicality. This article introduces the BIDR-16. In four studies, we shorten the BIDR from 40 items to 16 items, while retaining its two-factor structure, reliability, and validity. This short form will be invaluable to researchers wanting to assess social desirability when time is limited.

TI  - A Carbon Budget for Forests of the Conterminous United States
DO  - 10.2307/1942033
PY  - 1995///
AB  - The potential need for national-level comparisons of greenhouse gas emis- sions, and the desirability of understanding terrestrial sources and sinks of carbon, has prompted interest in quantifying national forest carbon budgets. In this study, we link a forest inventory database, a set of stand-level carbon budgets, and information on harvest levels in order to estimate the current pools and flux of carbon in forests of the conterminous United States. The forest inventory specifies the region, forest type, age class, productivity class, management intensity, and ownership of all timberland. The stand-level carbon bud- gets are based on growth and yield tables, in combination with additional information on carbon in soils, the forest floor, woody debris, and the understory. Total carbon in forests of the conterminous U.S. is estimated at 36.7 Pg, with half of that in the soil compartment. Tree carbon represents 33% of the total, followed by woody debris (10%), the forest floor (6%), and the understory (1%). The carbon uptake associated with net annual growth is 331 Tg, however, much of that is balanced by harvest-related mortality (266 Tg) and decomposition of woody debris. The forest land base at the national level is accumulating 79 Tg/yr, with the largest carbon gain in the Northeast region. The similarity in the mag- nitude of the biologically driven flux and the harvest-related flux indicates the importance of employing an age-class-based inventory, and of including effects associated with forest harvest and harvest residue, when modeling national carbon budgets in the temperate zone.

TI  - Pain in hemodialysis patients: prevalence, cause, severity, and management.
DO  - 10.1053/J.AJKD.2003.08.025
PY  - 2003///
AB  - BACKGROUND There is growing evidence that dialysis patients have a high burden of symptoms, including pain. However, the prevalence, cause, severity, and management of pain in dialysis patients have not been described. METHODS This prospective cohort study of 205 Canadian hemodialysis (HD) patients describes the prevalence, cause, severity, and management of pain in this population. A chart review for demographic and clinical data was conducted, and patients completed a questionnaire that incorporated the Brief Pain Inventory, followed by the McGill Pain Questionnaire. RESULTS One hundred three patients (50%) reported a problem with pain. Patients with pain had been on HD therapy longer (52.2 months) than those without pain (37.7 months). Causes of pain were diverse, and 18.4% of patients had more than a single cause of their pain. Musculoskeletal pain was most common (50.5%) and equal in severity to pain associated with peripheral neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease. Fifty-five percent of patients with pain rated their worst episode in the previous 24 hours as severe. Thirty-two percent of patients with pain were administered no analgesics, 29.1% were administered nonopioid analgesics, 26.2% were administered weak opioids, and 9.7% were administered strong opioids. The Pain Management Index describes the effectiveness of pain management and was negative in 74.8% of patients, indicating ineffective management. CONCLUSION Pain is a significant problem in more than 50% of HD patients and is not being effectively managed. The development of effective pain management strategies, underpinned by appropriate training and education, is necessary to improve the quality of life for dialysis patients.

AB  - Late in the 1980s, Hewlett-Packard HP faced inventories mounting into the billions of dollars and alarming customer dissatisfaction with its order fulfillment process. HP produces computation and measurement products whose supply chains include manufacturing integrated circuits, board assembly, final assembly, and delivery to customers. To reduce inventory and improve order fulfillment, HP called on an internal team of industrial engineers and management scientists augmented by academic collaboration. The team used an iterative process, enriched by the interaction of model development and application. HP reaped benefits well beyond its manufacturing operations, extending to diverse functions throughout the organization. Similarly, the academic partners have infused their research with real-life experience. The supply-chain methodology is now mature, and HP is transferring the technology into the product divisions.

TI  - The Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM): a 5-year review of research and clinical experience
DO  - 10.1038/sj.ijir.3901327
PY  - 2005///
AB  - The Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) is a widely used scale for screening and diagnosis of erectile dysfunction (ED) and severity of ED in clinical practice and research. In reviewing the SHIM-related literature, we sought to provide a compendium of studies in which the SHIM was used, to provide a systematic framework for organizing and evaluating the studies, and to provide a status report on the SHIM and its impact on the management of male sexual dysfunction. Using a Medline search, we found that the SHIM was an integral measure in at least 21 studies on the prevalence of ED, 23 studies on the efficacy of ED interventions, and eight other (mainly correlational) studies. The quantity of research and quality of scholarship on the SHIM provide testimony to its positive impact on understanding and improving male sexual function. These scientific contributions are likely to remain influential in coming years.

The current beetle outbreak in British Columbia is unprecedented in scale and will have unavoidable ecological and economic impacts. Unfortunately, this beetle outbreak may be a harbinger to an increased pest threat to Canadian forests. The abundance of mature age class timber in the inventory and a trend to warmer, drier summers and infrequent cold winter weather can combine to alter the balance between pest and host in forest ecosystems.

DO  - 10.1007/S10584-009-9576-4
PY  - 2009///
AB  - In many countries around the world impacts of climate change are assessed and adaptation options identified. We describe an approach for a qualitative and quantitative assessment of adaptation options to respond to climate change in the Netherlands. The study introduces an inventory and ranking of adaptation options based on stakeholder analysis and expert judgement, and presents some estimates of incremental costs and benefits. The qualitative assessment focuses on ranking and prioritisation of adaptation options. Options are selected and identified and discussed by stakeholders on the basis of a sectoral approach, and assessed with respect to their importance, urgency and other characteristics by experts. The preliminary quantitative assessment identifies incremental costs and benefits of adaptation options. Priority ranking based on a weighted sum of criteria reveals that in the Netherlands integrated nature and water management and risk based policies rank high, followed by policies aiming at ‘climate proof’ housing and infrastructure.

PY  - 2002///
AB  - Measuring management in networks is difficult because the allocation of managerial resources in network structures is fluid—that is, the utilization of management behaviors varies across time and space within a given program or project. As a means of focusing the network management research agenda, propositions based in contingency logic are suggested to test ideas regarding when, why, and how network managers undertake these behaviors. The propositions are intended to identify the vast inventory of network management behaviors and, most importantly, determine how the manager strategically matches behaviors with the governing context. Suggestions are also offered to help us understand how and why managerial resources are re allocated over time and space. The proposed research agenda is offered as a guide to help us determine which choices are most likely to be effective.

TI  - Information inaccuracy in inventory systems: stock loss and stockout
DO  - 10.1080/07408170590969861
PY  - 2005///
AB  - Many companies have automated their inventory management processes and now rely on information systems when making critical decisions. However, if the information is inaccurate, the ability of the system to provide a high availability of products at the minimal operating cost can be compromised. In this paper, analytical and simulation modelling demonstrate that even a small rate of stock loss undetected by the information system can lead to inventory inaccuracy that disrupts the replenishment process and creates severe out-of-stock situations. In fact, revenue losses due to out-of-stock situations can far outweigh the stock losses themselves. This sensitivity of the performance to the inventory inaccuracy becomes even greater in systems operating in lean environments. Motivated by an automatic product identification technology under development at the Auto-ID Center at MIT, various methods of compensating for the inventory inaccuracy are presented and evaluated. Comparisons of the methods reveal that the inventory inaccuracy problem can be effectively treated even without automatic product identification technologies in some situations.

DO  - 10.1002/J.2158-1592.2006.TB00241.X
PY  - 2006///
AB  - Many companies are using lean management and agility strategies to reduce costs, improve customer service and advance their competitive position. Lean thinking emphasizes the elimination of waste while agility stresses flexible, timely action in response to rapidly changing demand. While lean and agile supply chain strategies are often viewed as opposites, this paper supports the view that they do not necessarily compete and in fact can be employed simultaneously through a so-called "leagile" approach. Lean, agile and leagile strategies are illustrated by modeling their respective applications at a tier-1 supplier to the heating, ventilating and air-conditioning industry. Simulation analyses indicate that the lean system improves customer service performance while the leagile system results in lower enterprise-wide inventory levels under modeled circumstances. Analyses of the model output with regard to enterprise-wide costs and the sensitivity of the strategies to varying cost conditions suggests that tradeoffs exist among the three systems.

DO  - 10.2134/JEQ2005.0162
PY  - 2006///
AB  - This paper reviews the effects of past forest management on carbon stocks in the United States, and the challenges for managing forest carbon resources in the 21st century. Forests in the United States were in approximate carbon balance with the atmosphere from 1600-1800. Utilization and land clearing caused a large pulse of forest carbon emissions during the 19th century, followed by regrowth and net forest carbon sequestration in the 20th century. Recent data and knowledge of the general behavior of forests after disturbance suggest that the rate of forest carbon sequestration is declining. A goal of an additional 100 to 200 Tg C/yr of forest carbon sequestration is achievable, but would require investment in inventory and monitoring, development of technology and practices, and assistance for land managers.

TI  - Is the PCL-R Really the “Unparalleled” Measure of Offender Risk?
DO  - 10.1177/0093854802029004004
PY  - 2002///
AB  - The declaration that the Psychopathy Checklist–Revised (PCL-R) is the “unparalleled” measure of offender risk prediction is challenged. It is argued that such an assertion reflects an ethnocentric view of research in the area and has led to unsubstantiated claims based on incomplete attempts at knowledge cumulation. In fact, another more comprehensive risk measure, the Level of Service Inventory–Revised, notably surpasses the PCL-R in predicting general (φ = .37 vs. .23) and violent recidivism, albeit only modestly so in the case of the latter (φ = .26 vs. .21). In addition, other problematic issues regarding the PCL-R are outlined. Finally, it is suggested that a more useful role for psychopathy in offender risk assessment may be in terms of the responsivity dimension in case management. Finally, the authors suggest further research directions that will aid in knowledge cumulation regarding the general utility of offender risk measures.

TI  - Managerial Behavior, Entrepreneurial Style, and Small Firm Performance
DO  - 10.1111/1540-627X.00066
PY  - 2003///
AB  - Considerable effort has been devoted to identifying the general characteristics of entrepreneur; however, much of this has been conducted from a trait–based rather than from a behavioral perspective. In this study of small firms in the United Kingdom, we explored the relationships among managerial behaviors (based upon a competence model), entrepreneurial style (based on Covin and Slevin's theory), and firm type (in terms of sales growth performance). Principal components analysis of a management competence inventory identified six broad categories of managerial behavior. Regressing a measure of entrepreneurial style on these six behaviors suggested that managing culture and managing vision are related to an entrepreneurial style, while managing performance is related to a nonentrepreneurial style. Entrepreneurial style—but not managerial behavior—was associated positively with the probability that a firm would be a high–growth type. The results are discussed from the perspective of a model of small firm management that posits separate entrepreneurial, nonentrepreneurial, and generic management behaviors derived from a global competence space.

TI  - The Relative Importance of Working Capital Management and Its Components to SMEs Profitability
DO  - 10.1108/JSBED-12-2011-0029
PY  - 2013///
AB  - Purpose – This paper reports the results of an investigation of the relative importance of working capital management, measured by the cash conversion cycle (CCC), and its components (inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable) to the profitability of SMEs. Design/methodology/approach – The paper employs panel data regression analysis and a questionnaire survey on a sample of 133 Alternative Investment Market (AIM) listed SMEs. The panel data analysis utilises financial data for the period 2005 to 2009. The questionnaire survey results are based on 19 SMEs that responded. Findings – Panel data analysis results show that the management of accounts payable (AP) and accounts receivable (AR) is important for SMEs profitability. However, AP management is relatively more important than AR management. Inventory (INV) and CCC management is not important for SMEs profitability. Questionnaire results suggest that management of CCC and all its components is perceived as important for SMEs profitability. In terms of relative importance, AR management is most important, followed by AP, INV and CCC respectively.Research limitations/implications – The sample is limited to AIM listed SMEs, and therefore the findings cannot be generalised to all companies.Practical implications – Overall the results imply that the SMEs need to concentrate their limited resources on managing AR and AP in order to be more profitable.Originality/value – The study is the first to investigate the relative importance of WCM and its components to SMEs profitability and use both regression analysis and questionnaire survey.

TI  - What Is Missing in Amphibian Decline Research: Insights from Ecological Sensitivity Analysis
DO  - 10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.00433.x
PY  - 2002///
AB  - Abstract: Inventory, monitoring, and experimental studies have been the primary approaches for documenting and understanding the problem of amphibian declines. However, little attention has been given to placing human‐caused perturbations affecting one or more life‐history stages in the context of the overall population dynamics of particular species. We used two types of ecological sensitivity analysis to determine which vital rates have the strongest influence on the population dynamics of western toads (   Bufo boreas), red‐legged frogs (  Rana aurora), and common frogs (  Rana temporaria), pond‐breeding amphibians that have declined in all or portions of their ranges. Our results suggest that post‐metamorphic vital rates and highly variable vital rates both have a strong influence on the population dynamics of these species and therefore deserve more research and management attention. Ecological sensitivity analysis should be more widely applied to the issue of amphibian declines in order to identify the most plausible mechanisms of decline and prioritize which life‐history stages should be the focus of research and management efforts. Future experimental studies of perturbations in one or more life‐history stage should attempt to link the magnitude of the perturbation measured with the overall population‐level consequences. Finally, current research, inventory, and monitoring efforts should be supplemented with demographic studies so that quantitative analyses can be applied to a wider range of species and life‐history groups.

TI  - IMPACT OF WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ON PROFITABILITY
DO  - 10.19044/ESJ.2014.V10N1P%P
PY  - 2014///
AB  - The main purpose of this study is to empirically test the impact of working capital management on profitability .To investigate this relationship between these two, the author collected secondary data from Glaxo Smith Kline pharmaceutical company registered in Karachi stock exchange for the period of 1996-2011. For this purpose, in this study we use variable of return on assets ratio to measure the profitability of company and variables of account receivable turnover, creditors turnover, inventory turnover and current ratio as working capital management criteria. The results of the research show that there is a significant impact of the working capital management on profitability of company. Therefore, managers may enhance the profitability of their firms by minimizing the inventory turnover, account receivables ratio and by decreasing creditors turnover ratios but there is no significant effect of increasing or decreasing the current ratio on profitability. So, the results indicate that through proper working capital management the company can increase its profitability. This study will benefit the Pharmaceutical companies in the management of their working capital in such an efficient manner so that they can multiply their profitability.

PY  - 2010///
AB  - Purpose – Theory is needed for a discipline to mature. This research aims to provide a summary analysis of the theories being used in contemporary logistics and supply chain management (SCM) studies.Design/methodology/approach – A comprehensive literature review of articles appearing in five top tier logistics and SCM journals is conducted in order to identify how often theory is used and to classify the specific theories used. An analysis of the theoretical categories is presented to explain the type and frequency of theory usage.Findings – Over 180 specific theories were found within the sampled articles. Theories grouped under the competitive and microeconomics categories made up over 40 per cent of the theoretical incidences. This does not imply all articles utilize theory. The research found that theory was explicitly used in approximately 53 per cent of the sampled articles.Practical implications – Two implications are central. First, in the minds of editors, reviewers and authors is approximately 5...

TI  - An Analysis of Bid-Price Controls for Network Revenue Management
DO  - 10.1287/MNSC.44.11.1577
PY  - 1998///
AB  - Bid-prices are becoming an increasingly popular method for controlling the sale of inventoryin revenue management applications. In this form of control, threshold-or "bid"-prices are set for the resources or units of inventory (seats on flight legs, hotel rooms on specific dates, etc.) and a product (a seat in a fare class on an itinerary or room for a sequence of dates) is sold only if the offered fare exceeds the sum of the threshold prices of all the resources needed to supply the product. This approach is appealing on intuitive and practical grounds, but the theory underlying it is not well developed. Moreover, the extent to which bid-price controls represent optimal or near optimal policies is not well understood. Using a general model of the demand process, we show that bid-price control is not optimal in general and analyze why bid-price schemes can fail to produce correct accept/deny decisions. However, we prove that when leg capacities and sales volumes are large, bid-price controls are asymptotically optimal, provided the right bid prices are used. We also provide analytical upper bounds on the optimal revenue. In addition, we analyze properties of the asymptotically optimal bid prices. For example, we show they are constant over time, even when demand is nonstationary, and that they may not be unique.

PY  - 2011///
AB  - Hotel companies are struggling to keep up with the rapid consumer adoption of social media. Although many companies have begun to develop social media programs, the industry has yet to fully explore the potential of this emerging data and communication resource. The revenue management department, as it evolves from tactical inventory management to a more expansive role across the organization, is poised to be an early adopter of the opportunities afforded by social media. We propose a framework for evaluating social media-related revenue management opportunities, discuss the issues associated with leveraging these opportunities and propose a roadmap for future research in this area.

PY  - 2008///
AB  - Purpose - Lean management is getting more and more attention in today's highly competitive environment. In this context, the aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that efficient (lean) inventory management leads to an improvement in a firm's financial performance. Design/methodology/approach - Data for the analysis came from the ICAP database, which contains financial information on all medium to large Greek firms. The sample period extended from 2000 to 2002. For each year all manufacturing firms with the corporate form of Findings - Preliminary results, obtained by cross-section linear regressions, reveal that the higher the level of inventories preserved (departing from lean operations) by a firm, the lower its rate of returns. Findings are additionally tested by the use of pseudo-likelihood ratio test which constitutes a more reliable tool, thus verifying the robustness of the linearity of the relationship. Research limitations/implications - Given the great number of the possible determinants of performance it is difficult to isolate the effect of inventories even by using large samples and advanced methodologies. Originality/value - Since the results from other empirical studies on the microeconomic determinants and consequences of inventories are somewhat contradictory, this study sheds more light to this issue by employing more sophisticated statistical tests applied to a large and recent sample of Greek manufacturers across different industries.

TI  - RFID-based wireless manufacturing for real-time management of job shop WIP inventories
DO  - 10.1007/S00170-006-0897-4
PY  - 2008///
AB  - Modern manufacturing shop-floors suffer from a bottleneck of capturing and collection of real-time field information. Paper-based manual systems are time-consuming, prone to errors, tedious, and frequently damaged, lost or misplaced. As a result, the information does not accurately and promptly reflect the real-life situations and changes of the situations due to disturbances. Without up-to-date information, it is impossible to make accurate shop-floor decisions. This paper presents an affordable approach to shop-floor performance improvement by using wireless manufacturing (WM)—an emerging advanced manufacturing technology (AMT). WM relies substantially on wireless devices such as RFID (radio frequency identification) or auto-ID sensors and wireless information networks for the collection and synchronization of the real-time field data from manufacturing workshops. Emphasis is placed upon how to deploy WM technology for managing work-in-progress (WIP) inventories in manufacturing job shops with typical functional layouts. This approach avoids the change from functional to cellular layouts in order to retain existing operational flexibility while improving efficiency and capacity. Representative WIP logistic processes will be used to demonstrate how production and logistic operators and their supervisors accomplish their tasks in a WM shop-floor.

DO  - 10.1287/trsc.36.1.94.574
PY  - 2002///
AB  - Vendor managed inventory replenishment is a business practice in which vendors monitor their customers' inventories, and decide when and how much inventory should be replenished. The inventory routing problem addresses the coordination of inventory management and transportation. The ability to solve the inventory routing problem contributes to the realization of the potential savings in inventory and transportation costs brought about by vendor managed inventory replenishment. The inventory routing problem is hard, especially if a large number of customers is involved. We formulate the inventory routing problem as a Markov decision process, and we propose approximation methods to find good solutions with reasonable computational effort. Computational results are presented for the inventory routing problem with direct deliveries.

DO  - 10.1007/978-1-4899-7609-3
PY  - 2015///
AB  - This book focuses on the tactical planning level for spare parts management. It describes a series of multi-item inventory models and presents exact and heuristic optimization methods, including greedy heuristics that work well for real, life-sized problems. The intended audience consists of graduate students, starting scholars in the field of spare parts inventory control, and spare parts planning specialists in the industry. In individual chapters the authors consider topics including: a basic single-location model; single-location models with multiple machine types and/or machine groups; the multi-location model with lateral transshipments; the classical METRIC model and its generalization to multi-indenture systems; and a single-location model with an explicit modeling of the repair capacity for failed parts and the priorities that one can set there. Various chapters of the book are used in a master course at Eindhoven University of Technology and in a PhD course of the Graduate Program Operations Management and Logistics (a Dutch network that organizes PhD courses in the field of OM&L). The required pre-knowledge consists of probability theory and basic knowledge of Markov processes and queuing theory. End-of-chapter problems appear for all chapters, with some answers appearing in an appendix.

DO  - 10.3982/ECTA7451
PY  - 2007///
AB  - We document cash management patterns for households that are at odds with the predictions of deterministic inventory models that abstract from precautionary motives. We extend the Baumol-Tobin cash inventory model to a dynamic environment that allows for the possibility of withdrawing cash at random times at a low cost. This modification introduces a precautionary motive for holding cash and naturally captures developments in withdrawal technology, such as the increasing diffusion of bank branches and ATM terminals. We characterize the solution of the model and show that qualitatively it is able to reproduce the empirical patterns. Estimating the structural parameters we show that the model quantitatively accounts for key features of the data. The estimates are used to quantify the expenditure and interest rate elasticity of money demand, the impact of financial innovation on money demand, the welfare cost of inflation, the gains of disinflation and the benefit of ATM ownership.

DO  - 10.1111/1468-5906.00121
PY  - 2002///
AB  - The Spiritual Assessment Inventory (SAI) is a relationally-based measure designed to assess two dimensions of spiritual development: Awareness of God and Quality of Relationship with God. The present article reports the results of two studies: exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of a revised SAI, which replicated five factors, and a factor analysis of a revised SAI with a new Impression Management (IM) subscale. Results supported the factor structure of the SAI and the homogeneity of the IM scale. Correlations of the SAI subscales with the Spiritual Well-Being Scale, the Intrinsic/Extrinsic-Revised, the Bell Object Relations Inventory, the Defense Styles Questionnaire, and the Narcissistic Personality Inventory also supported the construct validity of the SAI. Two-step multiple regressions supported the incremental validity of the SAI. Suggestions for future research and implications for clinical use of the instrument are discussed.

TI  - Managing Disruption Risk: The Interplay Between Operations and Insurance
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.1120.1524
PY  - 2012///
AB  - Disruptive events that halt production can have severe business consequences if not appropriately managed. Business interruption (BI) insurance offers firms a financial mechanism for managing their exposure to disruption risk. Firms can also avail of operational measures to manage the risk. In this paper, we explore the relationship between BI insurance and operational measures. We model a manufacturing firm that can purchase BI insurance, invest in inventory, and avail of emergency sourcing. Allowing the insurance premium to depend on the firm's insurance and operational decisions, we characterize the optimal insurance deductible and coverage limit as well as the optimal inventory level. We prove that insurance and operational measures are not always substitutes, and we establish conditions under which they can be complements; that is, insurance can increase the marginal value of inventory and can increase the overall value of emergency sourcing. We also find that the value of insurance is higher for those firms less able to absorb financially significant disruptions. As disruptions become longer but rarer, the value of emergency sourcing increases, and the value of inventory and the value of insurance increase before eventually decreasing. This paper was accepted by Martin Lariviere, operations management.

TI  - Optical remote-sensing techniques for the assessment of forest inventory and biophysical parameters
DO  - 10.1177/030913339802200402
PY  - 1998///
AB  - Forests are the most widely distributed ecosystem on the earth, affecting the lives of most humans daily, either as an economic good or an environmental regulator. As forests are a complex and widely distributed ecosystem, remote sensing provides a valuable means of monitoring them. Remote-sensing instruments allow for the collection of digital data through a range of scales in a synoptic and timely manner. Accordingly, a variety of image-processing techniques have been developed for the estimation of forest inventory and biophysical parameters from remotely sensed images. The use of remotely sensed images allows for the mapping of large areas efficiently and in a digital manner that allows for accuracy assessment and integration with geographic information systems. This article provides a summary of the image-processing methods which may be applied to remotely sensed data for the estimation of forest structural parameters while also acknowledging the various limitations that are presented. Current advancements in remote-sensor technology are increasing the information content of remotely sensed data and resulting in a need for new analysis techniques. These advances in sensor technology are occurring concurrently with changes in forest management practices, requiring detailed measurements intended to enable ecosystem-level management in a sustainable manner. This review of remote-sensing image analysis techniques, with reference to forest structural parameters, illustrates the dependence between spatial resolution to the level of detail of the parameters which may be extracted from remotely sensed imagery. As a result, the scope of a particular investigation will influence the type of imagery required and the limits to the detail of the parameters that may be estimated. The complexity of parameters that may be extracted can be increased through combinations of image-processing techniques. For example, multitemporal analysis of image radiance values or multispectral image classification maps may be analysed to undertake the assessment of such forest characteristics as area of forest disturbances, forest succession and development, or sustainability of forest management practices. Further, the combination of spectral and spatial information extraction techniques shows promise for increasing the accuracy of estimates of forest inventory and biophysical parameters.

TI  - Imputing forest carbon stock estimates from inventory plots to a nationally continuous coverage
DO  - 10.1186/1750-0680-8-1
PY  - 2013///
AB  - The U.S. has been providing national-scale estimates of forest carbon (C) stocks and stock change to meet United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reporting requirements for years. Although these currently are provided as national estimates by pool and year to meet greenhouse gas monitoring requirements, there is growing need to disaggregate these estimates to finer scales to enable strategic forest management and monitoring activities focused on various ecosystem services such as C storage enhancement. Through application of a nearest-neighbor imputation approach, spatially extant estimates of forest C density were developed for the conterminous U.S. using the U.S.’s annual forest inventory. Results suggest that an existing forest inventory plot imputation approach can be readily modified to provide raster maps of C density across a range of pools (e.g., live tree to soil organic carbon) and spatial scales (e.g., sub-county to biome). Comparisons among imputed maps indicate strong regional differences across C pools. The C density of pools closely related to detrital input (e.g., dead wood) is often highest in forests suffering from recent mortality events such as those in the northern Rocky Mountains (e.g., beetle infestations). In contrast, live tree carbon density is often highest on the highest quality forest sites such as those found in the Pacific Northwest. Validation results suggest strong agreement between the estimates produced from the forest inventory plots and those from the imputed maps, particularly when the C pool is closely associated with the imputation model (e.g., aboveground live biomass and live tree basal area), with weaker agreement for detrital pools (e.g., standing dead trees). Forest inventory imputed plot maps provide an efficient and flexible approach to monitoring diverse C pools at national (e.g., UNFCCC) and regional scales (e.g., Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation projects) while allowing timely incorporation of empirical data (e.g., annual forest inventory).

TI  - Web-based global inventory of managed aquifer recharge applications
DO  - 10.1007/s40899-017-0212-6
PY  - 2018///
AB  - Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is being successfully implemented worldwide for various purposes: to increase groundwater storage, improve water quality, restore groundwater levels, prevent salt water intrusion, manage water distribution systems, and enhance ecological benefits. To better understand the role of MAR in sustainable water management and adaptation to climate and land use change, about 1200 case studies from 62 countries were collected and analyzed with respect to historical development, site characterization, operational scheme, objectives and methods used, as well as quantitative and qualitative characterization of in- and outflow of water. The data harvested was used for the compilation of a global inventory of MAR schemes, whose main goal is to provide access to existing MAR projects and techniques and demonstrate their benefits. To increase the availability and facilitate continuous update of the MAR inventory, an MAR web-based portal was developed and integrated into IGRAC’s Global Groundwater Information System. The MAR portal contains a “data layer catalog” containing the data arranged in a systematic way, a “map viewer” to visualize the selected data on a geographic location, and a “features panel” providing tabular output of the selected data. By facilitating access and promoting international sharing of information and knowledge on MAR, the web-based MAR portal aims to increase awareness of MAR as a viable solution for sustainable groundwater resources development and management, and to provide a new tool for better planning of MAR at regional and global scale.

TI  - ForestPlots.net: a web application and research tool to manage and analyse tropical forest plot data
DO  - 10.1111/J.1654-1103.2011.01312.X
PY  - 2011///
AB  - Tropical forests are biologically diverse ecosystems that play important roles in the carbon cycle and maintenance of global biodiversity. Understanding how tropical forests respond to environmental changes is important, as changes in carbon storage can modulate the rate and magnitude of climate change. Applying an ecoinformatics approach for managing long-term forest inventory plot data, where individual trees are tracked over time, facilitates regional and cross-continental forest research to evaluate changes in taxonomic composition, growth, recruitment and mortality rates, and carbon and biomass stocks. We developed ForestPlots.net as a secure, online inventory data repository and to facilitate data management of long-term tropical forest plots to promote scientific collaborations among independent researchers. The key novel features of the database are: (a) a design that efficiently deals with time-series data; (b) data management tools to assess potential errors; and (c) a query library to generate outputs (e.g. biomass and carbon stock changes over time).

Our results cover the finite-horizon case, with minimax (worst-case) objective, and convex state costs plus linear control costs. We develop a new proof methodology, which explores the relationship between the geometrical properties of the feasible set of solutions and the structure of the objective function. Apart from providing an elegant and conceptually simple proof technique, the approach also entails very fast algorithms for the case of piecewise-affine state costs, which we explore in connection with a classical inventory management application.

TI  - Beyond the throwaway society: A life cycle‐based assessment of the environmental benefit of reuse
DO  - 10.1002/ieam.1614
PY  - 2015///
AB  - In the context of a circular economy, sustainable consumption is often seen as the antithesis of current consumption patterns, which have led to the definition of the so‐called throwaway society. Reuse may provide a preferred alternative to other waste management options, because it promotes resource efficiency and may significantly reduce environmental impacts. To appraise the environmental benefits related to reuse of goods, a methodology adopting life cycle assessment (LCA) has been developed. A standardized procedure has been developed, identifying reference products within product category subject to reuse, and collecting reliable inventory data as a basis for calculating environmental impact through LCA. A case study on a second‐hand shop is presented, and the avoided impacts are quantified. Inventory data were taken both from the literature and directly from sales and surveys submitted to customers. The results are presented, highlighting: 1) for each product category, the average avoided impacts for 1 unit of reused product considered; and 2) for the overall activities of the second‐hand shop, the cumulative avoided impacts in 1 yr. In the case study, the higher contribution to avoided impacts comes from the apparel sector, due to the high amount of items sold, followed by the furniture sector, because of the high amount of environmental impacts avoided by the reuse of each single item.

TI  - Acquisitions, Productivity, and Profitability: Evidence from the Japanese Cotton Spinning Industry
DO  - 10.2139/ssrn.2471296
PY  - 2014///
AB  - We explore how changes in ownership and managerial control affect the productivity and profitability of producers. Using detailed operational, financial, and ownership data from the Japanese cotton spinning industry at the turn of the last century, we find a more nuanced picture than the straightforward "higher productivity buys lower productivity" story commonly appealed to in the literature. Acquired firms' production facilities were not on average less physically productive than the plants of the acquiring firms before acquisition, conditional on operating. They were much less profitable, however, due to consistently higher inventory levels and lower capacity utilization--differences which reflected problems in managing the uncertainties of demand. When purchased by more profitable firms, these less profitable acquired plants saw drops in inventories and gains in capacity utilization that raised both their productivity and profitability levels, consistent with acquiring owner/managers spreading their better demand management abilities across the acquired capital.

TI  - Robust Assortment Optimization in Revenue Management Under the Multinomial Logit Choice Model
DO  - 10.1287/opre.1120.1063
PY  - 2012///
AB  - We study robust formulations of assortment optimization problems under the multinomial logit choice model. The novel aspect of our formulations is that the true parameters of the logit model are assumed to be unknown, and we represent the set of likely parameter values by a compact uncertainty set. The objective is to find an assortment that maximizes the worst-case expected revenue over all parameter values in the uncertainty set. We consider both static and dynamic settings. The static setting ignores inventory consideration, whereas in the dynamic setting, there is a limited initial inventory that must be allocated over time. We give a complete characterization of the optimal policy in both settings, show that it can be computed efficiently, and derive operational insights. We also propose a family of uncertainty sets that enables the decision maker to control the trade-off between increasing the average revenue and protecting against the worst-case scenario. Numerical experiments show that our robust approach, combined with our proposed family of uncertainty sets, is especially beneficial when there is significant uncertainty in the parameter values. When compared to other methods, our robust approach yields over 10% improvement in the worst-case performance, but it can also maintain comparable average revenue if average revenue is the performance measure of interest.

TI  - Capacitated warehouse location model with risk pooling
DO  - 10.1002/NAV.20282
PY  - 2008///
AB  - In this article, we introduce the capacitated warehouse location model with risk pooling (CLMRP), which captures the interdependence between capacity issues and the inventory management at the warehouses. The CLMRP models a logistics system in which a single plant ships one type of product to a set of retailers, each with an uncertain demand. Warehouses serve as the direct intermediary between the plant and the retailers for the shipment of the product and also retain safety stock to provide appropriate service levels to the retailers. The CLMRP minimizes the sum of the fixed facility location, transportation, and inventory carrying costs. The model simultaneously determines warehouse locations, shipment sizes from the plant to the warehouses, the working inventory, and safety stock levels at the warehouses and the assignment of retailers to the warehouses. The costs at each warehouse exhibit initially economies of scale and then an exponential increase due to the capacity limitations. We show that this problem can be formulated as a nonlinear integer program in which the objective function is neither concave nor convex. A Lagrangian relaxation solution algorithm is proposed. The Lagrangian subproblem is also a nonlinear integer program. An efficient algorithm is developed for the linear relaxation of this subproblem. The Lagrangian relaxation algorithm provides near‐optimal solutions with reasonable computational requirements for large problem instances. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

DO  - 10.1108/JEA-09-2014-0117
PY  - 2015///
AB  - Purpose – Time demands faced by school principals make principals’ work increasingly difficult. Research outside education suggests that effective time management skills may help principals meet job demands, reduce job stress, and improve their performance. The purpose of this paper is to investigate these hypotheses. Design/methodology/approach – The authors administered a time management inventory to nearly 300 principals in Miami-Dade County Public Schools, the fourth-largest school district in the USA. The authors analyzed scores on the inventory descriptively and used them to predict time-use data collected via in-person observations, a survey-based measure of job stress, and measures of perceived job effectiveness obtained from assistant principals and teachers in the school. Findings – Principals with better time management skills allocate more time in classrooms and to managing instruction in their schools but spend less time on interpersonal relationship-building. Perhaps as a result of this trad...

Compared with the extant reviews (Raafat 1991; S.K.Goyal 2001), this paper reviews the recent studies from a different perspective. First, this paper proposes some key factors which should be considered in the deteriorating inventory studies; then, from the perspective of study scope, the current literatures are distinguished into two categories: the studies based on an enterprise and those based on supply chain. Literatures in each category are reviewed according to the key factors mentioned above. The literature review framework in this paper provides a clear overview of the deteriorating inventory study field, which can be used as a starting point for further study.

PY  - 2003///
AB  - We investigate dynamic policies for allocating scarce inventory to stochastic demand for multiple fare classes, in a network environment so as to maximize total expected revenues. Typical applications include sequential reservations for an airline network, hotel, or car rental service. We propose and analyze a new algorithm based on approximate dynamic programming, both theoretically and computationally. This algorithm uses adaptive, nonadditive bid prices from a linear programming relaxation. We provide computational results that give insight into the performance of the new algorithm and the widely used bid-price control, for several networks and demand scenarios. We extend the proposed algorithm to handle cancellations and no-shows by incorporating oversales decisions in the underlying linear programming formulation. We report encouraging computational results that show that the new algorithm leads to higher revenues and more robust performance than bid-price control.

DO  - 10.1037/0022-3514.82.4.527
PY  - 2002///
AB  - Three studies examined the terror management function of romantic commitment. In Study 1 (N = 94), making mortality salient led to higher reports of romantic commitment on the Dimensions of Commitment Inventory (J. M. Adams & W. H. Jones, 1997) than control conditions. In Study 2 (N = 60), the contextual salience of thoughts about romantic commitment reduced the effects of mortality salience on judgments of social transgressions. In Study 3 (N = 100), the induction of thoughts about problems in romantic relationships led to higher accessibility of death-related thoughts than did the induction of thoughts about either academic problems or a neutral theme. The findings expand terror management theory, emphasizing the anxiety-buffering function of close relationships.

PY  - 2005///
AB  - The Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (YLS/CMI) is a structured assessment tool designed to facilitate the effective intervention and rehabilitation of juvenile offenders by assessing each youth’s risk level and criminogenic needs. The present study examined the YLS/CMI’s reliability and validity in a sample of 107 juvenile offenders who were court-referred for mental health assessments. Results demonstrated the YLS/CMI’s internal consistency and interrater reliability. Moreover, the instrument’s predictive validity was substantiated on a number of recidivism measures for both males and females. Limitations of the current findings are discussed.

TI  - Assortment Planning and Inventory Decisions Under a Locational Choice Model
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.1060.0580
PY  - 2006///
AB  - We consider a single-period assortment planning and inventory management problem for a retailer, using a locational choice model to represent consumer demand. We first determine the optimal variety, product location, and inventory decisions under static substitution, and show that the optimal assortment consists of products equally spaced out such that there is no substitution among them regardless of the distribution of consumer preferences. The optimal solution can be such that some customers prefer not to buy any product in the assortment, and such that the most popular product is not offered. We then obtain bounds on profit when customers dynamically substitute, using the static substitution for the lower bound, and a retailer-controlled substitution for the upper bound. We thus define two heuristics to solve the problem under dynamic substitution and numerically evaluate their performance. This analysis shows the value of modeling dynamic substitution and identifies conditions in which the static substitution solution serves as a good approximation.

TI  - Inventories, Lumpy Trade, and Large Devaluations
DO  - 10.1257/AER.100.5.2304
PY  - 2008///
AB  - Fixed transaction costs and delivery lags are important costs of international trade. These costs lead firms to import infrequently and hold substantially larger inventories of imported goods than domestic goods. Using multiple sources of data, we document these facts. We then show that a parsimoniously parameterized model economy with importers facing an (S, s)-type inventory management problem successfully accounts for these features of the data. Moreover, the model can account for import and import price dynamics in the aftermath of large devaluations. In particular, desired inventory adjustment in response to a sudden, large increase in the relative price of imported goods creates a short-term trade implosion, an immediate, temporary drop in the value and number of distinct varieties imported, as well as a slow increase in the retail price of imported goods. Our study of 6 current account reversals following large devaluation episodes in the last decade provide strong support for the model's predictions.

TI  - Efficient Protocols for Identifying the Missing Tags in a Large RFID System
DO  - 10.1145/1860093.1860095
PY  - 2010///
AB  - Compared to the classical barcode system, radio frequency identification (RFID) extends the operational distance from inches to a number of feet (passive RFID tags) or even hundreds of feet (active RFID tags). Their wireless transmission, processing, and storage capabilities enable them to support full automation of many inventory management functions in industry. This paper studies the practically important problem of monitoring a large set of active RFID tags and identifying the missing ones-the objects that the missing tags are associated with are likely to be missing as well. This monitoring function may need to be executed frequently and therefore should be made efficient in terms of execution time in order to avoid disruption of normal inventory operations. Based on probabilistic methods, we design a series of missing-tag identification protocols that employ novel techniques to reduce the execution time. Our best protocol reduces the time for detecting the missing tags by an order of magnitude when compared to existing protocols.

TI  - Improved Algorithms for Economic Lot Size Problems
DO  - 10.1287/opre.41.3.549
PY  - 1993///
AB  - Many problems in inventory control, production planning, and capacity planning can be formulated in terms of a simple economic lot size model proposed independently by A. S. Manne (1958) and by H. M. Wagner and T. M. Whitin (1958). The Manne-Wagner-Whitin model and its variants have been studied widely in the operations research and management science communities, and a large number of algorithms have been proposed for solving various problems expressed in terms of this model, most of which assume concave costs and rely on dynamic programming. In this paper, we show that for many of these concave cost economic lot size problems, the dynamic programming formulation of the problem gives rise to a special kind of array, called a Monge array. We then show how the structure of Monge arrays can be exploited to obtain significantly faster algorithms for these economic lot size problems. We focus on uncapacitated problems, i.e., problems without bounds on production, inventory, or backlogging; capacitated problem...

TI  - Working Capital Management and Firm Profitability : Empirical Evidence from Manufacturing and Construction Firms Listed on Nairobi Securities Exchange , Kenya
PY  - 2014///
AB  - Working capital management plays a significant role in improved profitability of firms. Firms can achieve optimal management of working capital by making the trade-off between profitability and liquidity. This paper analyzes the effect of working capital management on firm’s profitability in Kenya for the period 2003 to 2012. For this purpose, balanced panel data of five manufacturing and construction firms each which are listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) is used. Pearson’s correlation and Ordinary Least Squares regression models were used to establish the relationship between working capital management and firm’s profitability. The study finds a negative relationship between profitability and number of day’s accounts receivable and cash conversion cycle, but a positive relationship between profitability and number of days of inventory and number of day’s payable. Moreover, the financial leverage, sales growth, current ratio and firm size also have significant effects on the firm’s profitability. Based on the key findings from this study it has been concluded that the management of a firm can create value for their shareholders by reducing the number of day’s accounts receivable. The management can also create value for their shareholders by increasing their inventories to a reasonable level. Firms can also take long to pay their creditors in as far as they do not strain their relationships with these creditors. Firms are capable of gaining sustainable competitive advantage by means of effective and efficient utilization of the resources of the organization through a careful reduction of the cash conversion cycle to its minimum. In so doing, the profitability of the firms is expected to increase.

DO  - 10.1287/trsc.2014.0523
PY  - 2015///
AB  - This paper investigates the integrated optimization of production, distribution, and inventory decisions related to supplying multiple retailers from a central production facility. A single-item capacitated lot-sizing problem is defined for optimizing production decisions and inventory management. The optimization of daily distribution is modeled as a traveling salesman problem or a vehicle routing problem depending on the number of vehicles. A two-phase iterative method, from which several heuristics are derived, is proposed that iteratively focuses on lot-sizing and distribution decisions. Computational results show that our best heuristic outperforms existing methods.

DO  - 10.1080/08941920.2015.1054976
PY  - 2015///
AB  - Citizen science is a useful approach for conducting scientific research; however, an understanding of the motivations, satisfactions, and other aspects of volunteers’ psychology is essential for conservation scientists wishing to mobilize this resource. We tested psychometric instruments for assessing the motivations, satisfactions, and advocacy role of volunteers with the Second Southern African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP2). Data were collected through stakeholder and volunteer surveys, and focus groups with the program's management. Qualitative and quantitative data analysis included content analysis, statistical tests of internal consistency, and factor analysis. An inventory, the Environmental Volunteer Functions Inventory (EVFI), was tested for assessing volunteer motivations along with scales for assessing volunteer satisfaction and level of advocacy. These scales revealed that volunteers in SABAP2 are satisfied with the program and exhibit behaviors suggesting they act as advocates for the program. Insights and a platform for adaptive management are provided for managers of the social dimensions of citizen science and other conservation programs.

TI  - High-fidelity national carbon mapping for resource management and REDD+
DO  - 10.1186/1750-0680-8-7
PY  - 2013///
AB  - BackgroundHigh fidelity carbon mapping has the potential to greatly advance national resource management and to encourage international action toward climate change mitigation. However, carbon inventories based on field plots alone cannot capture the heterogeneity of carbon stocks, and thus remote sensing-assisted approaches are critically important to carbon mapping at regional to global scales. We advanced a high-resolution, national-scale carbon mapping approach applied to the Republic of Panama – one of the first UN REDD + partner countries.ResultsIntegrating measurements of vegetation structure collected by airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with field inventory plots, we report LiDAR-estimated aboveground carbon stock errors of ~10% on any 1-ha land parcel across a wide range of ecological conditions. Critically, this shows that LiDAR provides a highly reliable replacement for inventory plots in areas lacking field data, both in humid tropical forests and among drier tropical vegetation types. We then scale up a systematically aligned LiDAR sampling of Panama using satellite data on topography, rainfall, and vegetation cover to model carbon stocks at 1-ha resolution with estimated average pixel-level uncertainty of 20.5 Mg C ha-1 nationwide.ConclusionsThe national carbon map revealed strong abiotic and human controls over Panamanian carbon stocks, and the new level of detail with estimated uncertainties for every individual hectare in the country sets Panama at the forefront in high-resolution ecosystem management. With this repeatable approach, carbon resource decision-making can be made on a geospatially explicit basis, enhancing human welfare and environmental protection.

TI  - Managing reverse logistics or reversing logistics management
PY  - 2004///
AB  - textabstractIn the past, supply chains were busy fine-tuning the logistics from raw material to the end customer. Today an increasing flow of products is going back in the chain. Thus, companies have to manage reverse logistics as well.This thesis contributes to a better understanding of reverse logistics. The thesis brings insights on reverse logistics decision-making and it lays down theoretical principles for reverse logistics as a research field.In particular it puts together a framework for reverse logistics identifying the elementary dimensions, providing typologies, and structuring their interrelations.With respect to aiding decision-making, this thesis comprises return handling and inventory management. On the first, the focus is on critical factors for the combination vs. separation of reverse and forward flows during material handling. On the second, the main research issue is the value of information. One of the findings is that more informed methods do not necessarily lead to the best performance.Furthermore, this thesis proposes a reflection on the future development of the field. Through a Delphi study with an international panel of academics working on the area, recommendations are made concerning both research and pedagogy. This thesis also poses the following question: is it a matter of simply managing reverse logistics or of reversing logistics management?The message is: logistics cannot go forward without reverse thinking!

DO  - 10.5465/AMLE.2008.32712617
PY  - 2008///
AB  - Tacit knowledge is believed to be one factor that distinguishes successful managers from others. We sought to determine whether levels of accumulated managerial tacit knowledge (LAMTK) were associated with managers' dominant learning styles. Instruments used in the study, involving 356 Malaysian public sector employees, included Sternberg et al.'s (2000) Tacit Knowledge Inventory for Managers and a normative version of Kolb's (1999a) Learning Styles Inventory (LSI-Ill). Findings suggest that LAMTK is independent of the length of subjects' general work experience, but positively related to the amount of time spent working in a management context. Learning styles also had a significant relationship. Subjects who spent most of their time performing management functions and whose dominant learning styles were accommodating had significantly higher LAMTK than those with different learning styles. We also found support for the belief that learners with a strong preference for all four different abilities defined in Kolb's learning theory may be critical for effective experiential learning.

TI  - Revenue Management for Parallel Flights with Customer-Choice Behavior
DO  - 10.1287/opre.1050.0194
PY  - 2005///
AB  - We consider the simultaneous seat-inventory control of a set of parallel flights between a common origin and destination with dynamic customer choice among the flights. We formulate the problem as an extension of the classic multiperiod, single-flight "block demand" revenue management model. The resulting Markov decision process is quite complex, owing to its multidimensional state space and the fact that the airline's inventory controls do affect the distribution of demand. Using stochastic comparisons, consumer-choice models, and inventory-pooling ideas, we derive easily computable upper and lower bounds for the value function of our model. We propose simulation-based techniques for solving the stochastic optimization problem and also describe heuristics based upon an extension of a well-known linear programming formulation. We provide numerical examples.

PY  - 1986///
AB  - In this paper, the joint problem of ordering and offering price discount by a supplier to his sole/major buyer is analyzed. The objective is to induce the buyer to alter his order schedule and size so that the supplier can benefit from lower set up, ordering, and inventory holding costs. We generalize the quantity discount pricing model of Monahan (Monahan, J. P. 1984. A quantity discount pricing model to increase vendor profits. Management Sci. 30 (6) 720--726.) to: (1) explicitly incorporate constraints imposed on the amount of discount that can be offered; and (2) relax the implicit assumption of a lot-for-lot (or order-for-order) policy adopted by the supplier. An algorithm is developed to solve the supplier's joint ordering and price discount problem.

DO  - 10.1080/00207540701543585
PY  - 2009///
AB  - There are many reasons for the growing interest in reverse logistics. The most prominent reasons are the growing concern for the environment and cost reduction. Next to environment, consumers demand for clean manufacturing and recycling. Hence, customers and retailers expect original equipment manufacturers to set up a proper reverse logistics system and expect the returned products to be processed and recovered in an environmentally responsible way and another reason is cost reduction. A well-managed reverse logistics programme can provide important cost savings in procurement, disposal, inventory carrying and transportation. In this context, looking at the entire supply chain is the best starting point for solutions. Supply chain management aims at the integration of traditional ‘forward’ supply chain processes, avoiding local optimisation by emphasising integrality. The main objective of this paper is to design an integrated forward logistics multi-echelon distribution inventory supply chain model (FLMEDIM) and closed loop multi-echelon distribution inventory supply chain model (CLMEDIM) for the built-to-order environment using genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimisation. In this paper, the proposed model is validated by considering two case studies: one for a tyre manufacturer and the other for a plastic goods manufacturer both located in the southern part of India. This paper utilises the multi-echelon distribution inventory supply chain model proposed by Haq and Kannan (2006a) for the FLMEDIM. The software used was written in the Java programming language.

TI  - Drivers of Finished-Goods Inventory in the U.S. Automobile Industry
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.1090.1095
PY  - 2010///
AB  - Automobile manufacturers in the U.S. supply chain exhibit significant differences in their days of supply of finished vehicles (average inventory divided by average daily sales rate). For example, from 1995 to 2004, Toyota consistently carried approximately 30 fewer days of supply than General Motors. This suggests that Toyota's well-documented advantage in manufacturing efficiency, product design, and upstream supply chain management extends to their finished-goods inventory in their downstream supply chain from their assembly plants to their dealerships. Our objective in this research is to measure for this industry the effect of several factors on inventory holdings. We find that two factors, the number of dealerships in a manufacturer's distribution network and a manufacturer's production flexibility, explain essentially all of the difference in finished-goods inventory between Toyota and three other manufacturers: Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors.

TI  - Inventory Management by Corporate Bond Dealers
DO  - 10.2139/ssrn.2966919
PY  - 2017///
AB  - In over-the-counter markets, dealer willingness to hold inventory is synonymous with liquidity provision. Using actively-traded corporate bonds over 2005-2014, I show that dealers often avoid taking bonds into inventory by prearranging trades. Dealers who take longer to unwind inventory prearrange more trades. Investors receive higher prices selling to dealers who prearrange trades and pay lower prices buying from them. Dealers unwind inventory mostly through interdealer trades. After the Volcker Rule was finalized, dealers were more reluctant to takes bonds into inventory, were more likely to offset trades within a day, and unwound inventory positions more quickly.

TI  - Customer-Base Concentration and Inventory Efficiencies: Evidence from the Manufacturing Sector
DO  - 10.1111/POMS.12417
PY  - 2016///
AB  - What is the link between customer-base concentration and inventory efficiencies in the manufacturing sector? Using hand-collected data from 10-K Filings, we find that manufacturers with more concentrated customer bases hold fewer inventories for less time and are less likely to end up with excess inventories, as indicated by the lower likelihood and magnitude of inventory write-downs and reversals. Using disaggregated inventory disclosures, we find that inventory efficiencies primarily flow through the finished goods inventory account, while raw material efficiencies are offset by higher work-in-process holdings and longer work-in-process cycles. In additional analysis, we document a valuation premium for more concentrated manufacturers after controlling for other firm characteristics, including default risk and cost of capital estimates. We conclude that investors trade off the costs and benefits of relationships with a limited number of major customers and, on balance, consider customer-base concentration as a net positive for firm valuation. Overall, our study adds to interdisciplinary research in accounting and operations management by shedding new light on the relevance of major customer disclosures for fundamental analysis and valuation in the manufacturing sector.

Using a model that explicitly captures the interaction of firms’ operations decisions and financial risks, this paper attempts to develop a deeper understanding of trade credit from an operational perspective.

Facing a trade credit contract, the retailer finances inventory using a portfolio of cash, trade credit, and short-term debt, where the structure of this inventory financing portfolio depends on the retailer’s financing need and bargaining power. Additionally, our model suggests that financial diversification, that is, employing multiple financing sources, provides an alternative explanation for the use of factoring in accounts receivable management and the decentralization of some supply chains.

DO  - 10.1001/ARCHINTE.1982.00340160057014
PY  - 1982///
AB  - Two hundred three patients with hypoxemic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 73 healthy control subjects matched for age, sex, race, and neighborhood of residence were administered three self-report inventories concerned with the following four dimensions of life quality: emotional functioning, social-role functioning, activities of daily living, and recreational pastimes. An additional inventory was administered to a spouse or another close relative of each patient. The life quality of patients with COPD was found to be impaired relative to healthy subjects on all dimensions. Depression was the preponderant emotional disturbance reported; difficulties with home management and reduction in social interaction were the primary social-role deficits. Ambulation, mobility, sleep and rest, and a variety of recreational pastimes were also severely affected. Life quality exhibited moderate but significant relationships to neuropsychological, pulmonary, and cardiac functioning and to exercise capability. Age and socioeconomic status were found to be possible moderators of the relationship of COPD to life quality. A model to integrate these findings is proposed. Implications for the management of COPD and for the evaluation of medical treatments of chronic disabling conditions are described.

PY  - 2010///
AB  - As soon as a firm starts operating and furthermore, the moment it starts to grow, it needs to come to a decision about how to invest funds, how much cash and inventory to hold on to, how much financing to provide to customers, how to obtain the necessary funds, how much debt to take on and in which terms-all the answers to these questions have serious consequences for a firm's cash flow and profitability. Working Capital Management is a hands-on look at the crucial decision of how to define and finance the operating investments of a business. Starting with an overview of the fundamental framework of corporate finance, the authors set out to define the central, and usually underestimated, role that working capital plays within this structure. They show not only how to prevent the losses that result from mishandling of working capital, but also how to fully exploit the strategic potential that intelligent, expert management of working capital allows. The book is the first to emphasize the relevance of the interplay between the investment and finance aspects of working capital, by discussing all of the main components of a firm's operating expenses from both an investment and finance perspective. After focusing on the varying aspects and themes of working capital, such as inventory management, strategic accounting, trade credit, and short-term debt, the authors move on to identify the long-term implications and opportunities raised by this often overlooked aspect of corporate finance. Lorenzo Preve and Virginia Sarria Allende have at last provided a resource that identifies the impact of day-to-day business decisions, uncovering a highly influential, aspect of all firms' financial situation.

TI  - Revenue Management's Renaissance
DO  - 10.1177/1938965508328716
PY  - 2009///
AB  - The era has ended when revenue management can stand alone as a tactical approach to room management. With technological and management support, revenue management must be and is being integrated into all aspects of hotel management marketing and operating strategies. Going beyond its role of managing room inventory, revenue management will consider total revenue contributions, including group business and its ancillary revenues. Because prices are essentially transparent, hotels will need to consider customer price elasticity and not simply match competitors' prices, with a goal of optimizing prices. Beyond that, revenue management can be used to manage all of the hotel's revenue streams, in part by considering the interaction of room sales and food and beverage sales. While revenue per available room (RevPAR) has been a good measure of performance, a revenue generation index, which compares competitors' RevPARs, is even more useful. Even more sophisticated is a revenue opportunity model, which monitors the effectiveness of inventory controls and analyzes the effects of revenue management decisions. Perhaps most promising is a customer-focused approach that tracks customers' purchases and targets promotions based on an understanding of customers' responses to prior offers.

AB  - Simulation is used to assist in the decision to implement lean manufacturing principles at an existing assembly operation. Models are developed for the existing assembly system, as well as for a new system (of similar capacity), that employ these principles. In addition to the manufacturing processes, the associated warehousing, inventory management, transportation, and production control/scheduling systems are included in the model to enable the quantification of lean manufacturing's impact on the total system. Simulation experiments measure each system's resource requirements and performance, thereby quantifying benefits to be derived from applying the shop-floor principles of lean manufacturing.

TI  - Retail Inventory Management When Records Are Inaccurate
DO  - 10.1287/msom.1070.0203
PY  - 2008///
AB  - Inventory record inaccuracy is a significant problem for retailers using automated inventory management systems. In this paper, we consider an intelligent inventory management tool that accounts for record inaccuracy using a Bayesian belief of the physical inventory level. We assume that excess demands are lost and unobserved, in which case sales data reveal information about physical inventory levels. We show that a probability distribution on physical inventory levels is a sufficient summary of past sales and replenishment observations, and that this probability distribution can be efficiently updated in a Bayesian fashion as observations are accumulated. We also demonstrate the use of this distribution as the basis for practical replenishment and inventory audit policies and illustrate how the needed parameters can be estimated using data from a large national retailer. Our replenishment policies avoid the problem of “freezing,” in which a physical inventory position persists at zero while the corresponding record is positive. In addition, simulation studies show that our replenishment policies recoup much of the cost of inventory record inaccuracy, and that our audit policy significantly outperforms the popular “zero balance walk” audit policy.

In a presentation that merges the theoretical interests of researchers with the practical interests of volunteer administrators, six different motivational functions served by volunteerism are identified, and an inventory designed to measure these motivations is presented. The implications of this functional approach for the recruitment, placement, and retention of volunteers are then elaborated. Finally, recommendations are provided for volunteer administrators who seek to increase the number of people who volunteer and to improve their human resource management.

TI  - Inventory Management of a Fast-Fashion Retail Network
DO  - 10.1287/opre.1090.0698
PY  - 2007///
AB  - Working in collaboration with Spain-based retailer Zara, we address the problem of distributing, over time, a limited amount of inventory across all the stores in a fast-fashion retail network. Challenges specific to that environment include very short product life cycles, and store policies whereby an article is removed from display whenever one of its key sizes stocks out. To solve this problem, we first formulate and analyze a stochastic model predicting the sales of an article in a single store during a replenishment period as a function of demand forecasts, the inventory of each size initially available, and the store inventory management policy just stated. We then formulate a mixed-integer program embedding a piecewise-linear approximation of the first model applied to every store in the network, allowing us to compute store shipment quantities maximizing overall predicted sales, subject to inventory availability and other constraints. We report the implementation of this optimization model by Zara to support its inventory distribution process, and the ensuing controlled pilot experiment performed to assess the model's impact relative to the prior procedure used to determine weekly shipment quantities. The results of that experiment suggest that the new allocation process increases sales by 3% to 4%, which is equivalent to $275 M in additional revenues for 2007, reduces transshipments, and increases the proportion of time that Zara's products spend on display within their life cycle. Zara is currently using this process for all of its products worldwide.

TI  - What Can Be Learned from Classical Inventory Models? A Cross-Industry Exploratory Investigation
DO  - 10.1287/msom.1070.0166
PY  - 2007///
AB  - Classical inventory models offer a variety of insights into the optimal way to manage inventories of individual products. However, top managers and industry analysts are often concerned with the aggregate macroscopic view of a firm's inventory rather than with the inventories of individual products. Given that classical inventory models often do not account for many practical considerations that a company's management faces (e.g., competition, industry dynamics, business cycles, the financial state of the company and of the economy, etc.) and that they are derived at the product level and not the firm level, can insights from these models be used to explain the inventory dynamics of entire companies? This exploratory study aims to address this issue using empirical data. We analyze absolute and relative inventories using a quarterly data panel that contains 722 public U.S. companies for the period 1992--2002. We have chosen companies that are not widely diversified and whose business in large part relies on inventory management to concentrate on empirically testing hypotheses derived from a variety of classical inventory models (economic order quantity (EOQ), [Q, r], newsvendor, periodic review, etc.). We find empirical evidence that firms operating with more uncertain demand, longer lead times, and higher gross margins have larger inventories. Furthermore, larger companies appear to benefit from economies of scale and therefore have relatively less inventory than smaller companies. We obtain mixed evidence on the relationship between inventory levels and inventory holding costs. We also analyze the breakdown of data into eight segments---oil and gas, electronics, wholesale, retail, machinery, hardware, food, and chemicals---and find that, with a few notable exceptions, our hypotheses are supported within the segments as well. Overall, our results demonstrate that many of the predictions from classical inventory models extend beyond individual products to the aggregate firm level; hence, these models can help with high-level strategic choices in addition to tactical decisions.

TI  - Robust Approximation to Multiperiod Inventory Management
DO  - 10.1287/opre.1090.0746
PY  - 2010///
AB  - We propose a robust optimization approach to address a multiperiod inventory control problem under ambiguous demands, that is, only limited information of the demand distributions such as mean, support, and some measures of deviations. Our framework extends to correlated demands and is developed around a factor-based model, which has the ability to incorporate business factors as well as time-series forecast effects of trend, seasonality, and cyclic variations. We can obtain the parameters of the replenishment policies by solving a tractable deterministic optimization problem in the form of a second-order cone optimization problem (SOCP), with solution time; unlike dynamic programming approaches, it is polynomial and independent on parameters such as replenishment lead time, demand variability, and correlations. The proposed truncated linear replenishment policy (TLRP), which is piecewise linear with respect to demand history, improves upon static and linear policies, and achieves objective values that are reasonably close to optimal.

DO  - 10.1111/J.1937-5956.2010.01120.X
PY  - 2010///
AB  - We examine the effects of product variety and inventory levels on store sales. Using 4 years of data from stores of a large retailer, we show that increases in product variety and inventory levels are both associated with higher sales. We also show that increasing product variety and inventory levels has an indirect negative effect on store sales through their impact on phantom products—products that are physically present at the store, but only in storage areas where customers cannot find or purchase them. Our study highlights a consequence of increased product variety and inventory levels that has previously been overlooked in studies of retail product variety and inventory management. It also quantifies the impact of phantom products on store sales. In addition, our study provides empirical evidence to support earlier claims that higher product variety and inventory levels lead to an increase in defect rate. We discuss the implications of our findings for retail inventory and assortment planning and for the design of retail stores.

TI  - Revenue Management Games: Horizontal and Vertical Competition
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.1040.0356
PY  - 2005///
AB  - A well-studied problem in the literature on airline revenue (or yield) management is the optimal allocation of seat inventory among fare classes, given a demand distribution for each class. In practice, the seat allocation decisions of one airline affect the passenger demands for seats on other airlines. In this paper, we examine the seat inventory control problem under both horizontal competition (two airlines compete for passengers on the same flight leg) and vertical competition (different airlines fly different legs on a multileg itinerary). Such vertical competition can be the outcome of a code-sharing agreement between airlines, because each airline sells seats on the partner airlines' flights but the airlines are unwilling, or unable, to coordinate yield management decisions. We provide a general sufficient condition under which a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium exists in these revenue management games, and we also compare the total number of seats available in each fare class with, and without, competition. Analytical results as well as numerical examples demonstrate that more seats are protected for higher-fare passengers under horizontal competition than when a single airline acts as a monopoly. Under vertical competition the booking limit may be higher or lower, however, than the monopoly level, depending on the demand for connecting flights in each fare class. Finally, we discuss revenue-sharing contracts that coordinate the actions of both airlines.

TI  - Supply chain strategy : the logistics of supply chain management
PY  - 2002///
AB  - This book provides high-tech and high-touch logistics solutions for supply chain challenges. In today's fast-paced and customer-oriented business environment, superior supply chain performance is a prerequisite to getting and staying competitive. "Supply Chain Strategy" is based on world-class logistics practices in place in successful supply chain organizations, the latest academic breakthroughs in logistics system design, and the logic of logistics. It presents the proven pillars of success in logistics and supply chain management. Part of McGraw-Hill's "Logistics Management Library", "Supply Chain Strategy" is organized according to author Dr. Ed Frazelle's breakthrough logistics master planning methodology. The methodology leads to metrics, process designs, system designs, and organizational strategies for total supply chain management, total logistics management, customer response, inventory planning and management, supply, transportation, and warehousing.Concise yet complete, Dr. Frazelle's book shows how to develop a comprehensive logistics and supply chain strategy, one that will both complement and support a company's strategic objectives and long-term success. Logistics - the flow of material, information, and money between consumers and suppliers - has become a key boardroom topic. It is the subject of cover features in business publications from "Wall Street Journal" to "BusinessWeek". Annual global logistics expenditures exceed $3.5 trillion, nearly 20 percent of the world's GDP, making logistics perhaps the last frontier for major corporations to significantly increase shareholder and customer value. And at the heart of every effort to improve organizational logistics performance? Supply chain efficiency. "Supply Chain Strategy" is today's most comprehensive resource for up-to-the-minute thinking and practices on developing supply chain strategies that support a company's overall objectives.Covering world-class practices and systems, taken from the files of Coca-Cola, Wal-Mart, General Electric, and other companies, it covers essential supply chain subjects including: logistics data mining - for identifying the root cause of material and information flow problems, pinpointing opportunities for process improvements, and providing an objective basis for project-team decision making; and, inventory planning and management - presenting metrics, processes, and systems for forecasting, demand planning, and inventory control, yielding lower inventory levels and improved customer service. It also covers: logistics information systems and Web-based logistics - helping to substitute information for inventory and work content; transportation and distribution - for connecting sourcing locations with customers at the lowest cost by, among other things, leveraging private and third-party transportation systems; and, logistics organization development - including the seven disciplines that link enterprises across the supply chain, as well as logistics activities within those enterprises."Supply Chain Strategy" explains and demonstrates how decision makers can use today's technology to enhance key logistics systems at every point in the supply chain, from the time an idea or product is conceived through its delivery to the final user. It describes the major steps in developing an effective, workable logistics management program - one that will reduce operating expenses, minimize capital investment, and improve overall customer service and satisfaction.

TI  - A review of methods for mapping and prediction of inventory attributes for operational forest management
DO  - 10.5849/FORSCI.12-134
PY  - 2014///
AB  - Forest inventory attributes are an important source of information for a variety of strategic and tactical forest management purposes. However, it is not possible or feasible for field inventories to be conducted contiguously across large areas, especially at a resolution fine enough to be useful for operational management. Therefore, a large number of quantitative modeling and prediction methods have been and are being developed and applied to predict and map forest attributes, with the goal of providing an accurate, spatially continuous, and detailed information base for practitioners of forestry and ecosystem management. This article reviews the most commonly used prediction techniques in the context of a comprehensive modeling framework that includes a discussion of methods, data sources, variable selection, and model validation. The methods discussed include regression, nearest neighbor, artificial neural networks, decision trees, and ensembles such as random forest. No single technique is revealed as universally superior for predicting forest inventory attributes; the ideal approach depends on goals, available training and ancillary data, and the modeler’s interest in tradeoffs between realism and statistical considerations. Useful ancillary data included in the models tend to include climate and topographic variables as well as vegetation indices derived from optical remote sensing systems such as Landsat. However, the use of airborne LiDAR in modeling of forest inventory attributes is increasing rapidly and shows promise for operational forest management applications. Different considerations are encapsulated within a generalized model development framework that provides a structure against which tradeoffs can be evaluated.

TI  - Roles of inventory and reserve capacity in mitigating supply chain disruption risk
DO  - 10.1080/00207543.2018.1504173
PY  - 2018///
AB  - This research focuses on managing disruption risk in supply chains using inventory and reserve capacity under stochastic demand. While inventory can be considered as a speculative risk mitigation lever, reserve capacity can be used in a reactive fashion when a disruption occurs. We determine optimal inventory levels and reserve capacity production rates for a firm that is exposed to supply chain disruption risk. We fully characterise four main risk mitigation strategies: inventory strategy, reserve capacity strategy, mixed strategy and passive acceptance. We illustrate how the optimal risk mitigation strategy depends on product characteristics (functional versus innovative) and supply chain characteristics (agile versus efficient). This work is inspired from a risk management problem of a leading pharmaceutical company.

TI  - A SIMULATION GAME FOR TEACHING SERVICE‐ORIENTED SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT: DOES INFORMATION SHARING HELP MANAGERS WITH SERVICE CAPACITY DECISIONS?*
DO  - 10.1111/J.1937-5956.2000.TB00322.X
PY  - 2009///
AB  - For decades, the Beer Game has taught complex principles of supply chain management in a finished good inventory supply chain. However, services typically cannot hold inventory and can only manage backlogs through capacity adjustments. We propose a simulation game designed to teach service-oriented supply chain management principles and to test whether managers use them effectively. For example, using a sample of typical student results, we determine that student managers can effectively use end-user demand information to reduce backlog and capacity adjustment costs. The game can also demonstrate the impact of demand variability and reduced capacity adjustment time and lead times.

TI  - Lot-sizing model with advance payment pricing and disruption in supply under planned partial backordering
DO  - 10.1111/itor.12297
PY  - 2017///
AB  - Inventory management is a group of policies used to enhance company efficiencies in using the inventory and decrease its related costs. Inventory management policies operate efficiently only in the normal market environment. When the manager faces disruption, the common decisions do not lead to optimality. In this paper, a lot-sizing model for when the retailer may face disruption is developed. A portion of purchasing cost should be spent before delivery by several predetermined equal-sized advanced payments; shortage is permitted and will be partially back-ordered. The total cost function includes purchasing, holding, capital, backordering, and lost sale costs. The optimal decisions are obtained after proving the convexity of the expected total cost function. Finally, a solution algorithm is presented and several numerical examples and analysis are provided to show that the developed model and derived results can be applied to real-world problems.

TI  - An Analytical Determination of Lead Time with Normal Demand
DO  - 10.1108/EUM0000000001287
PY  - 1991///
AB  - Almost all inventory models assume that lead time is prescribed and thus is not subject to control. In many practical situations, however, lead time is controllable; that is, lead time can be shortened, at the expense of extra costs, so as to improve customer service, reduce inventory investment in safety stocks, and improve system responsiveness. Although some authors recognise the advantage of short lead time and suggest that it should be considered a variable for management to control instead of a given, there is a lack of a suitable inventory model for determining the optimal lead time. A probabilistic inventory model in which the lead time is a decision variable is presented. It is assumed that the demand follows normal distribution and the lead time consists of n components each having a different cost for reduced lead time. The objective is to determine the lead time that minimises the sum of the expected holding cost and the additional cost.

PY  - 2008///
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to suggest that the theory of constraints (TOC) can serve as a general theory in operations management. The paper first investigate linkages between TOC and the core concepts/components of operations management (OM) and show how OM concepts can be integrated with TOC using examples from the published TOC literature. A second important purpose is to show that TOC, as a theory, has properties essential for a good theory.Design/methodology/approach – Using a commonly accepted categorization of operations decisions (process, quality, inventory and capacity), traditional views, and approaches to operations decisions to those inherent in the TOC are compared.Findings – The paper concludes that the TOC provides approaches to operations decisions that avoid pitfalls of local optimization by reaching across functional boundaries in organizations. In addition, while the TOC appears to meet the criteria of a good theory, it has not been empirically tested for the most part.Orig...

TI  - Newsvendor Networks: Inventory Management and Capacity Investment with Discretionary Activities
DO  - 10.1287/msom.4.4.313.5728
PY  - 2002///
AB  - We introduce a class of models, callednewsvendor networks, that allow for multiple products and multiple processing and storage points and investigate how their single-period properties extend to dynamic settings. Such models provide a parsimonious framework to study various problems of stochastic capacity investment and inventory management, including assembly, commonality, distribution, flexibility, substitution and transshipment. Newsvendor networks are stochastic models with recourse that are characterized by linear revenue and cost structures and a linear input-output transformation. While capacity and inventory decisions are locked in before uncertainty is resolved, some managerial discretion remains via ex-post input-output activity decisions. Ex-post decisions involve both the choice of activities and their levels and can result in subtle benefits. This discretion in choice is captured through alternate or "nonbasic" activities that can redeploy inputs and resources to best respond to resolved uncertain events. Nonbasic activities are never used in a deterministic environment; their value stems from discretionary flexibility to meet stochastic demand deviations from the operating point.The optimal capacity and inventory decisions balance overages with underages. Continuing the classic newsvendor analogy, the optimal balancing conditions can be interpreted as specifying multiple "critical fractiles" of the multivariate demand distribution; they also suggest appropriate measures for and trade-offs between product service levels. This paper shows that the properties of optimal newsvendor network solutions extend to a dynamic setting under plausible conditions. Indeed, we establish dynamic optimality of inventory and capacity policies for the lost sales case. Depending on the nonbasic activities, this also extends to the backordering case. Analytic- and simulation-based solution techniques and graphical interpretations are presented and illustrated by a comprehensive example that features discretionary input commonality and a flexible processing resource.

Our discourse begins with a brief overview of electronic distribution as practiced in the airline industry, emphasizing the fundamental role of central reservation and revenue management systems. Methods for controlling the sale of inventory are then introduced along with related techniques for optimization and forecasting. Research contributions and areas of significant research potential are given special attention. We conclude by looking at how revenue management is practiced outside of the airline industry, its relationship to dynamic pricing, and future directions for the discipline.

TI  - A Branch-Price-and-Cut Algorithm for the Inventory-Routing Problem
DO  - 10.1287/trsc.2015.0635
PY  - 2014///
AB  - The inventory-routing problem IRP integrates two well-studied problems, namely, inventory management and vehicle routing. Given a set of customers to service over a multiperiod horizon, the IRP consists of determining when to visit each customer, which quantity to deliver in each visit, and how to combine the visits in each period into feasible routes such that the total routing and inventory costs are minimized. In this paper, we propose an innovative mathematical formulation for the IRP and develop a state-of-the-art branch-price-and-cut algorithm for solving it. This algorithm incorporates known and new families of valid inequalities, including an adaptation of the well-known capacity inequalities, as well as an ad hoc labeling algorithm for solving the column generation subproblems. Through extensive computational experiments on a widely used set of 640 benchmark instances involving between two and five vehicles, we show that our branch-price-and-cut algorithm clearly outperforms a state-of-the-art branch-and-cut algorithm on the instances with four and five vehicles. In this instance set, 238 were still open before this work and we proved optimality for 54 of them.

DO  - 10.1057/PALGRAVE.JORS.2601154
PY  - 2001///
AB  - It would seem appropriate to first declare an interest. The senior author is a long-standing friend, and we have shared in writing one paper. I am included in an extensive list of acknowledgements, which otherwise reads like a Who’s Who of the OR=OM world. The first and second editions referred to one of my earliest papers: a reference omitted from this third edition. So honours are about even! The book has been divided into five parts. The first discusses inventory management and production planning in relation to business strategy, with a chapter devoted to the determination of forecasting strategy and the selection of forecasting methods. The second part is concerned with traditional decision systems for the inventory control of individual items, taking into account seasonal demand, probabilistic demand, and different attitudes of management toward costing the risk of insufficient capacity in the short run. The third part deals with special classes of items: including the most important (Class A), the large group of lowactivity items (Class C) and style goods and perishable items (the newsboy problem). Part Four considers coordination of groups of items: first, in a family of items, at a single location, that have something in common such as a supplier, or transport mode or production equipment and secondly in a multi-echelon framework. The final part is concerned with decision making in a production environment and covers aggregate production planning, MRP, ERP, JIT, OPT, and short-range production scheduling. It will be helpful for those who know the previous editions to be aware of the following significant changes from the second edition. A third author, David Pyke, has joined the team. Surprisingly, this is not pointed out in the preliminary pages. His particular interest seems to be in supply chain management and multi-echelon inventories and a new chapter is added that incorporates some of the latest research and experiences of leading firms. A greater emphasis on the use of spreadsheets, and a consequent reduction in emphasis on graphical and tabular aids in decision making. New chapters are devoted to just-in-time (JIT), with a discussion of optimised production technology (OPT), and to production scheduling. Introductions to enterprise resource planning systems (ERP), such as SAP, and the economic lot scheduling problem are provided. More coverage of both operations strategy and of the news vendor problemand itsapplication tostyle,or fashion,goods. Significant updating of the references to the academic and practitioner literature, and expanded end-of-chapter problem sets. Removal of the MIDAS case to supplementary material.

AB  - An integrated optimization model for production and distribution planning is proposed, with the aim of optimally coordinating important and interrelated logistic decisions such as capacity management, inventory allocation, and vehicle routing. The integrated model is solved via Lagrangean relaxation and both lower bounds and heuristic feasible solutions are obtained. Computational results on test problems of various sizes are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed solution scheme. Moreover, the feasible solution obtained is compared to that generated by an alternative decoupled approach in which a production plan is first developed and a distribution schedule is consequently derived. Computational results seem to indicate a substantial advantage of the synchronized approach over the decoupled decision process.

TI  - Retailer- vs. Vendor-Managed Inventory and Brand Competition
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.1030.0174
PY  - 2004///
AB  - Vendor-managed inventory (VMI) is emerging as a significant development in the recent trend towards collaboration and information sharing in supply chain management. Transfer of inventory monitoring and other overhead costs to manufacturers and continuous replenishment of retailer inventory are commonly cited as potential benefits that VMI offers to retailers. We provide a new explanation in this paper for why retailers might be interested in VMI. We show that VMI intensifies the competition between manufacturers of competing brands and that the increased competition benefits a retailer that stocks these brands. Competition arises because of brand substitution; that is, some consumers may switch to another brand if their "preferred" brand is out of stock. The manufacturer whose brand is out of stock thus risks losing sales from those consumers who buy the competing brand. Consequently, each manufacturer has an incentive to keep a higher stock of its own brand, not only to satisfy the demand from its customers, but also the spillover demand that arises if a competing brand goes out of stock. When the retailer makes the stocking-level decisions, the competition is mitigated by the pooling of demands at the retailer. VMI restores the competition between the manufacturers and benefits the retailer.

AB  - As global markets grow increasingly efficient, competition no longer takes place between individual businesses, but between entire supply chains. Collaboration can provide the competitive edge that enables all the business partners in a supply chain to prevail and grow. This paper presents a framework for customer‐supplier collaboration that facilitates effective and efficient supply chain operation. The paper reveals that the level of involvement of customers and suppliers differs across different supply chain processes and also across different sectors. While the involvement of customers is high in demand management and product development, the involvement of suppliers is high in transportation and inventory management processes. The paper also reveals that about 50 percent of the organizations surveyed indicate that suppliers and customers have little or virtually no role in the demand management, inventory management, and product development processes.

DO  - 10.1007/S10346-010-0213-0
PY  - 2010///
AB  - Landslides constitute one of the most important natural hazards in Italy as they are widespread and result in considerable damage and fatalities every year. The Italian Landslide Inventory (IFFI) Project was launched in 1999 with the aim of identifying and mapping landslides over the entire Italian territory. The inventory currently holds over 480,000 landslides and has been available by means of Web services since 2005. The aim of this study is to define quality indices for evaluation of the homogeneity and completeness of the IFFI database. In order to estimate the completeness of the landslide attribute information, a heuristic approach has been used to assign weighting values to significant parameters selected from the landslide data sheet. The completeness and homogeneity of the landslide mapping has been evaluated by means of three different methods: an area-frequency distribution analysis; the proximity of the landslides surveyed to urban areas; variation of the landslide index within the same lithology. The quality indices have allowed identification of areas with a high level of completeness and critical areas in which the data collected have been underestimated or are not very accurate. The quality assessment of collected and stored data is essential in order to use the IFFI database for definition and implementation of landslide susceptibility models and for land use planning and management.

TI  - Effective Inventory and Service Management Through Product and Process Redesign
DO  - 10.1287/opre.44.1.151
PY  - 1996///
AB  - One of the major challenges to operational managers is product proliferation. Product proliferation makes it difficult to forecast demands accurately, and consequently, leads to high inventory investment and poor customer service. Such proliferation is often a result of the global nature of the market place. Different markets may have different requirements for the product, due to differences in taste, language, geographical environment, or government regulations. Another reason for product proliferation is the expansion of the customer base. Different product versions are often developed for different market segments e.g., education, personal, business, or government users may have different needs of a product. To gain control of inventory and service, significant benefits can be obtained by properly exploring the opportunities in the design of the product or the process by which the product is made. Logistic issues like inventory and service are thus important dimensions that design engineers should consider, in addition to measures like functionality, performance, and manufacturability. This paper describes how some simple inventory models can be used to support the logistic dimensions of product/process design. Actual examples are used for illustration.

AB  - We study several joint facility location and inventory management problems with stochastic retailer demand. In particular, we consider cases with uncapacitated facilities, capacitated facilities, correlated retailer demand, stochastic lead times, and multicommodities. We show how to formulate these problems as conic quadratic mixed-integer problems. Valid inequalities, including extended polymatroid and extended cover cuts, are added to strengthen the formulations and improve the computational results. Compared to the existing modeling and solution methods, the new conic integer programming approach not only provides a more general modeling framework but also leads to fast solution times in general.

TI  - Managing Global Sourcing: Inventory Performance
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.2013.1816
PY  - 2014///
AB  - The use of global suppliers has increased considerably over the last three decades. Operations management theory establishes that global sourcing requires more units of inventory, but since these units are often procured at a lower cost from global suppliers the capital invested in inventory and the consequent financial burden may increase or decrease with global sourcing. This study provides rigorous firm-level empirical evidence that links the global sourcing practices of public U.S. firms and their inventory investments. We process bill of lading manifests customs forms to extract information on over half a million sea shipments from global suppliers to U.S. public firms and link this information with quarterly financial data from the Compustat database. We provide stylized facts on the participation of different firms and sectors in global trade. Using a simultaneous equation model, we find that an increase in global sourcing results in an increase in inventory investment. A 10% shift in sourcing from domestic to global suppliers increases the inventory investment by 8.8% for an average firm in our sample. We also find that increasing the number of suppliers can mitigate this increase in inventory investment: for example, going from single to dual sourcing reduces inventory investment by about 11%. We illustrate the use of our estimates to identify the impact of changing global sourcing strategy on inventory investment and operational performance metrics.

PY  - 2002///
AB  - Enterprise resource planning (ERP) and supply‐chain management (SCM) have been growing in popularity across various industries. New initiatives in resources planning, electronic commerce and extended supply chain drive the trend among corporations towards integrating strategic business applications. ERP systems assist enterprises in automating and integrating corporate cross‐functions such as inventory control, procurement, distribution, finance and project management. Through information sharing, SCM enables supply‐chain partners to work in close coordination to facilitate supplier‐customer interactions and minimize transaction cost. This research examines these two important concepts in terms of their evolution, functions and current development and further explores the rationales for their integration by analyzing the problems of ERP and presenting the solutions of SCM. This study is concluded with the imminent development of SCM and EPR systems and the industrial trend toward their integration.

PY  - 2008///
AB  - Different stock keeping units (SKUs) are associated with different underlying demand structures, which in turn require different methods for forecasting and stock control. Consequently, there is a need to categorize SKUs and apply the most appropriate methods in each category. The way this task is performed has significant implications in terms of stock and customer satisfaction. Therefore, categorization rules constitute a vital element of intelligent inventory management systems. Very little work has been conducted in this area and, from the limited research to date, it is not clear how managers should classify demand patterns for forecasting and inventory management. A previous research project was concerned with the development of a theoretically coherent demand categorization scheme for forecasting only. In this paper, the stock control implications of such an approach are assessed by experimentation on an inventory system developed by a UK-based software manufacturer. The experimental database consists of the individual demand histories of almost 16 000 SKUs. The empirical results from this study demonstrate considerable scope for improving real-world systems.

TI  - The Stabilizing Effect of Inventory in Supply Chains
DO  - 10.1287/opre.46.3.S72
PY  - 1998///
AB  - This paper presents a hierarchical model framework for the analysis of the stabilizing effect of inventories in multiechelon manufacturing/distribution supply chains. This framework is used to compare the variance of demand to the variance of replenishment orders at different echelons of the system (e.g., retailer, wholesaler). Empirical data and experience with management games suggest that, in most industries, inventory management policies can have a destabilizing effect by increasing the volatility of demand as it passes up through the chain (the "bullwhip" effect). Our model helps to explain these observations and indicates mechanisms that can promote stabilization. The analysis results also define sufficient conditions for the existence of stabilization and relate these conditions to the optimality of myopic control policies.

TI  - Dynamic Stochastic Inventory Management with Reference Price Effects
DO  - 10.1287/opre.2016.1524
PY  - 2016///
AB  - We analyze the joint inventory and pricing decisions of a firm when demand depends on not only the current selling price but also a memory-based reference price and customers are loss averse. The presence of reference price effect leads to a nonconcave one-period expected revenue in price and reference price. We introduce a transformation technique that allows us to prove under some mild assumptions the optimality of a reference-price-dependent base-stock list-price policy, which is characterized by a base-stock level and a target reference price. In addition, we show that the target reference price is increasing in the reference price, but except in the loss-neutral case, the base-stock level is not monotone in the reference price. We also show that in the steady state of the model with the reference price effect, the optimal price is lower while the optimal base-stock level is higher than their counterparts in the model without the reference price effect.

PY  - 2006///
AB  - Radio frequency identification systems have many applications in manufacturing, supply chain management, inventory control, and telemedicine. In an RFID system, products and objects are given RFID tags to identify themselves. However, security and privacy issues pose significant challenges on these systems. In this article we first briefly introduce RFID systems. Then two RFID applications in telemedicine are proposed: studying supply and demand of doctors, nurses, and patients in hospitals and healthcare, and developing mobile telemedicine services. The security and privacy issues of RFID, and their solutions are discussed as well.

TI  - Solving Stochastic Ship Fleet Routing Problems with Inventory Management Using Branch and Price
DO  - 10.1007/978-3-319-29975-4_8
PY  - 2016///
AB  - This chapter describes a stochastic ship routing problem with inventory management. The problem involves finding a set of least cost routes for a fleet of ships transporting a single commodity when the demand for the commodity is uncertain. Storage at supply and consumption ports is limited and inventory levels are monitored in the model. Consumer demands are at a constant rate within each time period, and in the stochastic problem, the demand rate for a period is not known until the beginning of that period. The demand situation over the time periods is described by a scenario tree with corresponding probabilities. A decomposition formulation is given and it is solved using a Branch and Price framework. A master problem (set partitioning with extra inventory constraints) is built, and the subproblems, one for each ship, are solved by stochastic dynamic programming and yield the columns for the master problem. Each column corresponds to one possible tree of actions for one ship giving its schedule loading/unloading quantities for all demand scenarios. Computational results are given showing that medium sized problems can be solved successfully.

TI  - Applying Risk/Need Assessment to Probation Practice and its Impact on the Recidivism of Young Offenders
DO  - 10.1177/0093854811421596
PY  - 2011///
AB  - Evaluating the extent to which case management practices are guided by risk/need assessment is important because the impact of the assessment process will not be realized if the instrument is not applied as fully intended. This study investigated whether risk/need assessment is linked to the case management of young offenders and whether adherence to the principles of risk, need, and responsivity, as part of the case management plan, is related to recidivism. Data were collected on a sample of 192 young offenders. The Level of Service Inventory–Saskatchewan Youth Edition (LSI-SK) total score and seven of the eight subscale scores were positively correlated with recidivism. Generally, the LSI-SK was used to inform supervision intensity and interventions toward criminogenic needs. Moreover, adherence to the need principle was associated with reductions in recidivism. Implications for case management and direction for future research are discussed.

TI  - Stalking Information: Bayesian Inventory Management with Unobserved Lost Sales
DO  - 10.1287/MNSC.45.3.346
PY  - 1999///
AB  - Retailers are frequently uncertain about the underlying demand distribution of a new product. When taking the empirical Bayesian approach of Scarf 1959, they simultaneously stock the product over time and learn about the distribution. Assuming that unmet demand is lost and unobserved, this learning must be based on observing sales rather than demand, which differs from sales in the event of a stockout. Using the framework and results of Braden and Freimer 1991, the cumulative learning about the underlying demand distribution is captured by two parameters, a scale parameter that reflects the predicted size of the underlying market, and a shape parameter that indicates both the size of the market and the precision with which the underlying distribution is known. An important simplification result of Scarf 1960 and Azoury 1985, which allows the scale parameter to be removed from the optimization, is shown to extend to this setting. We present examples that reveal two interesting phenomena: 1 A retailer may hope that, compared to stocking out, realized demand will be strictly less than the stock level, even though stocking out would signal a stochastically larger demand distribution, and 2 it can be optimal to drop a product after a period of successful sales. We also present specific conditions under which the following results hold: 1 Investment in excess stocks to enhance learning will occur in every dynamic problem, and 2 a product is never dropped after a period of poor sales. The model is extended to multiple independent markets whose distributions depend proportionately on a single unknown parameter. We argue that smaller markets should be given better service as an effective means of acquiring information.

TI  - Uncertainty in estimating land use and management impacts on soil organic carbon storage for US agricultural lands between 1982 and 1997
DO  - 10.1046/j.1365-2486.2003.00683.x
PY  - 2003///
AB  - Uncertainty was quantified for an inventory estimating change in soil organic carbon (SOC) storage resulting from modifications in land use and management across US agricultural lands between 1982 and 1997. This inventory was conducted using a modified version of a carbon (C) accounting method developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Probability density functions (PDFs) were derived for each input to the IPCC model, including reference SOC stocks, land use/management activity data, and management factors. Change in C storage was estimated using a Monte‐Carlo approach with 50 000 iterations, by randomly selecting values from the PDFs after accounting for dependencies in the model inputs. Over the inventory period, mineral soils had a net gain of 10.8 Tg C yr−1, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 6.5 to 15.3 Tg C yr−1. Most of this gain was due to setting‐aside lands in the Conservation Reserve Program. In contrast, managed organic soils lost 9.4 Tg C yr−1, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 6.4 to 13.3 Tg C yr−1. Combining these gains and losses in SOC, US agricultural soils accrued 1.3 Tg C yr−1 due to land use and management change, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from a loss of 4.4 Tg C yr−1 to a gain of 6.9 Tg C yr−1. Most of the uncertainty was attributed to management factors for tillage, land use change between cultivated and uncultivated conditions, and C loss rates from managed organic soils. Based on the uncertainty, we are not able to conclude with 95% confidence that change in US agricultural land use and management between 1982 and 1997 created a net C sink for atmospheric CO2.

PY  - 2008///
AB  - Justice systems depend on risk assessment instruments to identify juveniles who have the greatest likelihood to re-offend. This study was an attempt to validate the Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory as a predictor of re-offense for young offenders between the ages of 10 and 16. Although 26% of youth in the sample (n = 328) re-offended, there were significant differences in offense rates among juveniles classified as high risk, moderate risk, and low risk. The YLS/CMI also had a high correct classification rate, which was reflected in an AUC of .62. Finally, youth of different risk levels also showed differences in time to re-offense rates. Results indicate further study of the YLS/CMI's validity with girls and minorities is necessary. Furthermore, risk prediction could be improved by inclusion of ecological predictive variables related to delinquency.

We first give a brief summary of the basic solution concepts in non-cooperative and cooperative games such as Nash and Stackelberg equilibria, Nash arbitration scheme and cooperation with sidepayments. the core, the Shapley value and nucleolus. Our review of supply chain-related game theoretical applications is presented in five areas: (i) Inventory games with fixed unit purchase cost, (ii) Inventory games with quantity discounts, (iii) Production and pricing competition, (iv) Games with other attributes, (v) Games with joint decisions on inventory, production/pricing and other attributes. The paper concludes with a summary of our review, suggestions for potential applications of game theory in SCM and an alternative classification of all reviewed papers.

TI  - Development and validation of the pain response inventory for children.
DO  - 10.1037/1040-3590.9.4.392
PY  - 1997///
AB  - The Pain Response Inventory (PRI) was developed as a multidimensional instrument to assess children's coping responses to recurrent pain. The PRI assesses 3 broad coping factors—Active, Passive, and Accommodative—each with subscales representing specific strategies for coping with pain. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to derive and cross-validate the factor structure of the PRI in 3 different samples of children and adolescents: school children, abdominal pain patients, and former abdominal pain patients. The subscales were found to be internally consistent and reasonably stable. Validity of the subscales was assessed by examining the relations of particular coping strategies to various outcome indicators, including functional disability, somatization symptoms, and depressive symptoms. Results indicated that different types of health outcome were predicted by different patterns of PRI coping strategies, thus supporting the utility of a multidimensional approach to the assessment of coping responses to pain. With the formulation of the gate-control theory of pain (Melzack & Wall, 1965), it became generally recognized that the experience of pain is not a purely sensory phenomenon related to tissue damage. Rather, it is also influenced by cognitive, behavioral, and emotional factors. This model suggests that effective pain management cannot rely solely on interventions directed at the source of tissue damage but also must include interventions designed to modify psychosocial factors that affect nociceptive processing (McGrath & Hillier, 1996). This multidimensional model of pain has been the impetus for the rapid growth in behavioral science research on pain in the past two decades. Cognitive and behavioral responses to pain, often studied under the rubric of "coping with pain," are of particular interest because they may be amenable to change through interventions by health professionals. Moreover, such coping responses may significantly lessen pain and associated disability and thereby complement and even decrease the need for more invasive pharmacological or surgical interventions. Studies of adult pain patients suggest that certain coping strategies (typically ' 'passive'' strategies, such as taking to bed, restricting one's activities, or

TI  - Statistical forecasting for inventory control
DO  - 10.2307/2342487
PY  - 1960///
AB  - This book explains how to design an economical, efficient inventory-control system through better routine short-range forecasting, with suggestions for adapting the system to your specific needs. Practical methods based on sound mathematical theory are given for computing the average rate of demand and the maximum reasonable demand during a lead time. Moving averages, exponential smoothing, and averages with optimum weights are developed and described in detail, including the adaptation to secular trends, to abrupt changes in the market, and to seasonal patterns. The author clearly shows how the concept of the Z-transform can be applied to the analysis and solution of inventory control problems. Techniques for measuring the uncertainty in a forecast are explained as a guide to the necessary and sufficient allowance for protective inventories. Direct measurements of the average and of the uncertainty are combined into effective ordering rules. The beginning of each chapter develops the concepts in non-technical terms that can be readily understood by readers in management. The main part of the book presents the methods with a minimum of mathematics, but in sufficient detail to be useful to industrial engineers. The appendixes give rigorous mathematical developments. Included in the appendixes is material on how to develop a simulation of a system to evaluate it, an analytical technique for studying the response of the system, and statistical methods for estimating in advance the impact of any control system on total costs, total inventories, and total service. xmlui.dri2xhtml.METS1.0.item-descriptionmiscellaneous 233 p., fig., ref. bib. : 6 p.3/4 URI http://hdl.handle.net/2042/28540 Date 1959 Identifiant P402 This item appears in the following Collection(s) 1.

TI  - Robust Inventory Routing Under Demand Uncertainty
DO  - 10.1287/trsc.1110.0387
PY  - 2012///
AB  - This paper introduces a robust inventory routing problem where a supplier distributes a single product to multiple customers facing dynamic uncertain demands over a finite discrete time horizon. The probability distribution of the uncertain demand at each customer is not fully specified. The only available information is that these demands are independent and symmetric random variables that can take some value from their support interval. The supplier is responsible for the inventory management of its customers, has sufficient inventory to replenish the customers, and distributes the product using a capacitated vehicle. Backlogging of the demand at customers is allowed. The problem is to determine the delivery quantities as well as the times and routes to the customers, while ensuring feasibility regardless of the realized demands, and minimizing the total cost composed of transportation, inventory holding, and shortage costs. Using a robust optimization approach, we propose two robust mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations for the problem. We also propose a new MIP formulation for the deterministic (nominal) case of the problem. We implement these formulations within a branch-and-cut algorithm and report results on a set of instances adapted from the literature.

TI  - If the Inventory Manager Knew: Value of Visibility and RFID under Imperfect Inventory Information
DO  - 10.2139/ssrn.1351606
PY  - 2009///
AB  - Today many companies rely on computerized tracking of inventory. Although computerized inventory tracking is generally assumed to be accurate, in reality, actual on-hand inventory deviates from the inventory record, which distorts the replenishment process and compromises good inventory management. Discrepancy between the inventory record and physical stock has mainly three sources: shrinkage, misplacement and transaction errors. Due to these factors, the actual stock levels are not known with certainty. Therefore, the system fails to order when it should or it carries more inventory than necessary. Periodic inventory audits are the most common approach to maintaining inventory record accuracy. In this paper, we consider a finite horizon, single-item periodic review inventory control problem in which inventory records are inaccurate. Inventory errors accumulate until an inventory count is conducted. After the inventory count, the inventory record is reconciled: error is corrected and all misplaced items are returned to inventory. We explicitly model how different error sources lead to inventory discrepancies. First we determine effective replenishment policies that use information about actual inventory movement and error sources and minimize total expected inventory cost. Next we also determine a replenishment policy that accounts for inventory inaccuracy without having complete visibility to inventory and error sources. By comparing the total cost of using these replenishment policies, we quantify the true value of inventory visibility, as well as the value of elimination or reduction of the sources of inventory discrepancies offered by the latest tracking technologies such as RFID.

DO  - 10.1287/inte.33.6.44.25189
PY  - 2002///
AB  - IBM is among the pioneers recognizing the benefits of closed-loop supply chains that integrate product returns into business operations. We worked on a project exploiting product returns as a source of spare parts. Key decisions concern what recovery opportunities to use, the channel design, and coordinating alternative supply sources. Our analytic inventory-control model and a simulation model showed that procurement-cost savings largely outweigh reverse logistics costs and that information management is essential. These findings provide a basis for significantly expanding the usage of the novel parts supply source, thereby cutting procurement costs.

TI  - Working capital management and firm profitability
DO  - 10.1007/S00187-013-0173-3
PY  - 2013///
AB  - Managing a firm’s current assets and liabilities (working capital management) is highly relevant to the success of that firm. While the short-term liquidity effects of working capital management are straightforward to derive, it is an empirical question how it affects firm profitability. This short survey paper consolidates the empirical literature on the association between working capital management and firm profitability. This state of the art analysis provides evidence of positive effects of accounts receivable management and inventory management on profitability. However, results for the effects of accounts payable management on profitability are driven by reverse causality. Finally, this paper highlights critical aspects of prior research and points to avenues for future research.

TI  - A Branch-and-Price Method for a Liquefied Natural Gas Inventory Routing Problem
DO  - 10.1287/trsc.1100.0317
PY  - 2010///
AB  - We consider a maritime inventory routing problem in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) business, called the LNG inventory routing problem (LNG-IRP). Here, an actor is responsible for the routing of the fleet of special purpose ships, and the inventories both at the liquefaction plants and the regasification terminals. Compared to many other maritime inventory routing problems, the LNG-IRP includes some complicating aspects such as (1) a constant rate of the cargo evaporates each day and is used as fuel during transportation; (2) variable production and consumption of LNG, and (3) a variable number of tanks unloaded at the regasification terminals. The problem is solved by a branch-and-price method. In the column generation approach, the master problem handles the inventory management and the port capacity constraints, while the subproblems generate the ship route columns. Different accelerating strategies are implemented. The proposed method is tested on instances inspired from real-world problems faced by a major energy company.

TI  - Reaching Law Approach to the Sliding Mode Control of Periodic Review Inventory Systems
DO  - 10.1109/TASE.2014.2314690
PY  - 2014///
AB  - In this paper, a discrete-time sliding mode inventory management strategy based on a novel non-switching type reaching law is introduced. The proposed reaching law eliminates undesirable chattering, and ensures that the sliding variable rate of change is upper bounded by a design parameter which does not depend on the system initial conditions. This approach guarantees fast convergence with non-negative, upper limited supply orders, and ensures that the maximum stock level may be specified a priori by the system designer. Furthermore, a sufficient condition for 100% customers' demand satisfaction is derived. The inventory replenishment system considered in this paper involves multiple suppliers with different lead times and different transportation losses in the delivery channels.

TI  - Comparing Continuous and Dichotomous Scoring of the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding
DO  - 10.1207/S15327752JPA7802_10
PY  - 2002///
AB  - The Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR; Paulhus, 1994) is a widely used instrument to measure the 2 components of social desirability: self-deceptive enhancement and impression management. With respect to scoring of the BIDR, Paulhus (1994) authorized 2 methods, namely continuous scoring (all answers on the continuous answer scale are counted) and dichotomous scoring (only extreme answers are counted). In this article, we report 3 studies with student samples, and continuous and dichotomous scoring of BIDR subscales are compared with respect to reliability, convergent validity, sensitivity to instructional variations, and correlations with personality. Across studies, the scores from continuous scoring (continuous scores) showed higher Cronbach's alphas than those from dichotomous scoring (dichotomous scores). Moreover, continuous scores showed higher convergent correlations with other measures of social desirability and more consistent effects with self-presentation instructions (fake-good vs. fake-bad instructions). Finally, continuous self-deceptive enhancement scores showed higher correlations with those traits of the Five-factor model for which substantial correlations were expected (i.e., Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness). Consequently, these findings indicate that continuous scoring may be preferable to dichotomous scoring when assessing socially desirable responding with the BIDR.

DO  - 10.1080/00207543.2014.988889
PY  - 2015///
AB  - A location-inventory problem (LIP) aims to integrate strategic supply chain design decisions with tactical and operational inventory management decisions. This study provides an extensive review of the existing literature of LIP modelling. A mathematical model is presented for a basic LIP, which can be further developed to incorporate additional features for use in real-world scenarios. We also discuss the evolution of LIP modelling literature over the past three decades and provide summary tables outlining characteristics of the published works including key modelling attributes and objective function cost components. Additional classifications are completed based on the solution methods adopted and real-world applications investigated. Our observations provide important insights and identify potential directions for future research in the field.

TI  - Validation of Scores on the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale and the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding
DO  - 10.1177/0013164404267285
PY  - 2005///
AB  - The Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MCSDS), the most commonly used social desirability bias (SDB) assessment, conceptualizes SDB as an individual’s need for approval. The Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR) measures SDB as two separate constructs: impression management and self-deception. Scores on SDB scales are commonly used to validate other measures although insufficiently validated themselves. This study used college students’ responses to the MCSDS and the BIDR to investigate their factorial validity. Using confirmatory factor analysis, neither a one-nor a two-factor model was found to be strongly supported. It is recommended that researchers be cautious when using scores on these SDB scales until their dimensionality is better understood.

TI  - Working Capital Management and Corporate Profitability: Evidence from Iran
PY  - 2011///
AB  - The main objective of this research is studying the relationship between working capital management and profitability. Cash conversion cycle is one of the important measuring tools to calculate the efficiency of working capital management. The time realm of the research was 2001-2006 and the studied companies have been the ones accepted in Tehran stock exchange. In general, out of 2628 companies; the company has been selected as a top company for 1063. Then multiple regression and Pearson's correlation was used to test the hypothesis. The results of the statistical test of the hypothesis indicate that there is a negative significant relation between number of days accounts receivable and profitability, a negative significant relation between Inventory turnover in days and profitability, a direct significant relation between number of day's accounts payables and profitability and there is a negative significant relation between cash conversion cycle and profitability. The results of the research show that in the studied companies, there is a significant relation between working capital management and profitability and working capital management has a great effect on the profitability of the companies and the managers can create value for shareholders by means of decreasing receivable accounts and inventory.

TI  - Sensitivity Analysis for Base-Stock Levels in Multiechelon Production-Inventory Systems
DO  - 10.1287/MNSC.41.2.263
PY  - 1995///
AB  - Effective management of inventories in large-scale production and distribution systems requires methods for bringing model solutions closer to the complexities of real systems. Motivated by this need, we develop simulation-based methods for estimating sensitivities of inventory costs with respect to policy parameters. These sensitivity estimates are useful in adjusting optimal parameters predicted by a simplified model to complexities that can be incorporated in a simulation. We consider capacitated, multiechelon systems operating under base-stock policies and develop estimators of derivatives with respect to base-stock levels. We show that these estimates converge to the correct value for finite-horizon and infinite-horizon discounted and average cost criteria. Our methods are easy to implement and experiments suggest that they converge quickly. We illustrate their use by optimizing base-stock levels for a subsystem of the PC assembly and distribution system of a major computer manufacturer.

DO  - 10.1111/j.1365-2214.2010.01162.x
PY  - 2011///
AB  - BACKGROUND Parents of young children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are responsible for executing a complex daily management regimen and are at risk for elevated levels of stress. Normative misbehaviour during the preschool years can complicate T1D management, and interpretation of behavioural concerns may vary because of child health status and parent stress. Within a paediatric transactional model framework, child characteristics (e.g. behaviour problems, metabolic control) and parent functioning (e.g. parenting stress, anxiety) likely impact one another. METHODS Parents of 2- to 6-year-old children with T1D completed self-report measures, including the Pediatric Inventory for Parents (PIP), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI), and 24-h Recall Interviews. Medical data were obtained by parent report and medical record review. It was hypothesized that greater parent stress and child blood glucose variability would be significantly associated with greater parent-reported child behaviour concerns. RESULTS Moderate levels of parent stress and child behaviour problems were endorsed; however, parents perceived children's misbehaviour as problematic, particularly with relation to tasks relevant to diabetes management (e.g. bedtimes and mealtimes). Structural equation modelling indicated that greater general anxiety and paediatric parenting stress was associated with parent report of more problematic child behaviour. Blood glucose variability did not significantly contribute to this relationship. CONCLUSIONS The stress experienced by parents of young children with chronic illness appears to relate to their perception of their children's behaviour problems. Parents' experiences with developmentally normative misbehaviour may interfere with disease management and exacerbate parents' stress and the subsequent impact on well-being. Implications for supporting parents and children with T1D are discussed.

TI  - Inventory management of surgical supplies and sterile instruments in hospitals: a literature review
DO  - 10.1080/20476965.2018.1496875
PY  - 2018///
AB  - ABSTRACT Operating rooms are considered a significant revenue source, as well as the main source of waste and cost, among the hospital’s departments. Any cost savings in operating rooms will have a broad financial impact. Over the last decades, many researchers and practitioners have conducted studies to deal with the issue of managing surgical supplies and instruments, which are highly affected by surgeons’ preferences. The purpose of this article is to present an up-to-date review of research in the field of inventory management of surgical supplies and instruments. We have analysed the literature in a systematic manner and organised the identified papers into two groups: the papers that were published by scientific researchers and developed optimisation techniques and the papers that were published by practitioners and reported their observations of the current issues in the operating room. We also identify the future research directions leading to operating room inventory cost reduction.

TI  - Optimal production, replenishment, delivery, routing and inventory management policies for products with perishable inventory
DO  - 10.17632/3M48BTYBWD.1
PY  - 2018///
AB  - Abstract This paper presents a generalized production-inventory-routing model with perishable inventory. We analyze the optimal integrated decisions of when and how much to deliver and sell products with varying manufacturing periods. We discuss main inventory management policies to demonstrate the applicability of the model in real-world applications for production routing problems (PRPs) with perishable inventory. Furthermore, an exact branch-and-cut algorithm is developed and discussed. We introduce new families of logical, strengthened lot-sizing and lifted Miller–Tucker–Zemlin subtour elimination constraints for the PRP with perishable inventory. Finally, we test the performance of the algorithm. We also implement and compare 8 suboptimal delivery and selling priority policies with an optimized policy to develop managerial implications.

DO  - 10.1111/J.1937-5956.1997.TB00430.X
PY  - 2009///
AB  - Campbell Soup's continuous replenishment (CR) program is a novel innovation designed to improve the efficiency of inventory management throughout the supply chain. With CR (1) retailers pay a constant wholesale price but continue to participate in consumer promotions, (2) retailers transmit to the supplier daily inventory information via electronic data interchange (EDI), and (3) the supplier assumes responsibility for managing retailer inventories, i.e., vendor managed inventories (VMI). We develop simple inventory management rules to operate CR, and we test these rules with a simulation using actual demand data provided by Campbell Soup. On this sample we find that retailer inventories were reduced on average by 66% while maintaining or increasing average fill rates. This improvementreduces a retailer's cost of goods sold by 1.2%, which is significant in the low profitmargin grocery industry. Furthermore, these savings could have been achieved without VMI.

TI  - Indigenous management of tropical forest ecosystems: the case of the Kayapó indians of the Brazilian Amazon
DO  - 10.1007/BF00122640
PY  - 1985///
AB  - The Kayapó Indians of Brazil's Amazon Basin are described as effective managers of tropical forest, utilizing an extensive inventory of useful native plants that are concentrated by human activity in special forest areas (resource islands, forest fields, forest openings, tuber gardens, agricultural plots, old fields, and trailsides). Long-term transplanting and selection of plants suggest semi-domestication of many species. The overall management strategies of forest also includes many manipulated animal species (birds, fish, bees, mammals) utilized as food and game. Forest patches (apêtê) are created by Indians from campo/cerrado using planting zones made from termite and ant nests mixed with mulch: formation and development of these is briefly discussed, including the implications for new ideas concerning reforestation and campo management. Finally an integrative cognitive model is presented showing the relationships between variants of forest and savanna recognized by the Kayapó. Indigenous knowledge of subtle similarities between conceptually distinct ecological units in the model allows for the interchange of botanical material between microclimates to increase biological diversity in managed areas. It is suggested that indigenous knowledge is extremely important in developing new strategies for forest and campo/cerrado conservation, while improving productiveness of these ecological systems. Such knowledge is not only applicable for Amazônian Indians, but also has far-reaching implications for human populations throughout the humid tropics.

DO  - 10.1890/1051-0761(1999)009[0968:SPOAPA]2.0.CO;2
PY  - 1999///
AB  - We developed maps of aboveground production and mortality of woody biomass for forests of the eastern United States based on data collected from an extensive network of permanent plots remeasured by the U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis units (FIA). Forest volume inventory data for growth and mortality were converted to units of aboveground biomass at the county level for hardwood and softwood forest types. Aboveground production of woody biomass (APWB) for hardwood forests ranged from 0.6 to 28 Mg·ha−1·yr−1 and averaged 5.2 Mg·ha−1·yr−1. For softwood forests, APWB ranged from 0.2 to 31 Mg·ha−1·yr−1 and averaged 4.9 Mg·ha−1·yr−1. Aboveground production of woody biomass was generally highest in southeastern and southern counties, mostly along an arc from southern Virginia to Louisiana and eastern Texas. Although this pattern is generally the result we would expect from the general climatic gradients of the region, it was confounded by the effects of different forest management intensities. ...

PY  - 2014///
AB  - A new remote sensing based stand management inventory system was developed and adopted to operational forestry in Finland during the years 2005–2010. The inventory is based on wall-to-wall mapping of the inventory area. The outcome of the inventory is species-specific stand attributes which are estimated with the help of ALS, aerial images and field sample plots. The new inventory system has been successful and within a few years all the actors of the practical forestry have updated their inventory and planning systems to support the new method. The new inventory system is now applied for almost 3,000,000 ha annually. This chapter presents the main properties of the system.

TI  - The adoption of RFID in fashion retailing: a business value-added framework
DO  - 10.1108/02635570810876732
PY  - 2008///
AB  - Purpose – The adoption of radio frequency identification (RFID) will create a revolutionary change in the management of a supply chain, particularly in the retail sector. The aim of this paper is to study the views of fashion retailers on RFID applications and, in turn, to analyze the added value to be gained by adopting this technology.Design/methodology/approach – A two‐stage methodological approach was adopted.

TI  - Inventorying Geological Heritage in Large Territories: A Methodological Proposal Applied to Brazil
DO  - 10.1007/S12371-010-0014-9
PY  - 2010///
AB  - An adequate management of geological heritage by national and regional authorities presupposes the existence of a solid geosites inventory. Unfortunately, this is not the case for many countries. Most often, there is no national inventory at all or the method and criteria used to assess geosites was not adequate. This paper makes an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the most common procedures to produce a geosite inventory and proposes a methodology particularly adapted for large territories such as Brazil. Nevertheless, this methodological approach can be easily adapted to any other geographical or geological setting, promoting the characterization and conservation of the world's geological heritage.

PY  - 1997///
AB  - Shows that manufacturing companies place a strong emphasis on the role of supply‐chain management ‐ the management of supplies, suppliers, inventory and distribution. Much of the literature talks about the trend to reduce supplier base. Database analysis gave empirical evidence of this trend in UK manufacturing companies ‐ 201 companies from different industrial sectors cut their supplier base over the last four years, by 9 per cent in the household products sector and approximately 35 per cent in the process, engineering and electronics sectors. Reports on further research at four companies, looking at their experiences with suppliers and establishes that a key reason for supplier base reduction is to free time to manage the remaining suppliers more effectively. Identifies the criteria used for supplier selection and reasons why single‐sourcing was avoided. Suggests that these findings on supplier management have implications for both researchers and managers in industry.

PY  - 1999///
AB  - Supply chain management deals with the management of material, information, and financial flows in a network consisting of vendors, manufacturers, distributors and customers. Managing flows in this network is a major challenge due to the complexity (in space and time) of the network, the proliferation of products (often with short life cycles) that flow through this network, and the presence of multiple decision makers who each own and operate a piece of this network and optimize a private objective function. Supply chain management clearly involves a variety of issues including product/process design, production, third party logistics and outsourcing, supplier contracting, incentives and performance measures, multi-location inventory coordination, etc.

DO  - 10.1108/01443571211250112
PY  - 2012///
AB  - Purpose – Stock keeping unit (SKU) classifications are widely used in the field of production and operations management. Although many theoretical and practical examples of classifications exist, there are no overviews of the current literature, and general guidelines are lacking with respect to method selection for classifying SKUs. The purpose of this paper is to systematically synthesise the earlier work in this area, and to conceptualise and discuss the factors that influence the choice of a specific SKU classification.Design/methodology/approach – The paper structurally reviews existing contributions and synthesises these into a conceptual framework for SKU classification.Findings – How SKUs are classified depends on the classification aim, the context and the method that is chosen. In total, three main production and operations management aims were found: inventory management, forecasting and production strategy. Within the method three decisions are identified to come to a classification: the chara...

TI  - Clearance Pricing and Inventory Policies for Retail Chains
DO  - 10.1287/MNSC.44.3.285
PY  - 1998///
AB  - Clearance pricing and end of season inventory management are challenging and important problems in retailing. Sales rates depend upon price, seasonal effects, and the remaining assortment of items available to customers. There is little time to react to observed sales, and pricing errors result in either loss of potential revenue or excess inventory to be liquidated. This paper develops optimal clearance prices and inventory management policies that take into account the impact of reduced assortment and seasonal changes on sales rates. Versions of these policies have been tested and implemented at three major retail chains and these applications are summarized and discussed.

TI  - Information Sharing as a Coordination Mechanism for Reducing the Bullwhip Effect in a Supply Chain
DO  - 10.1109/TSMCC.2006.887014
PY  - 2007///
AB  - The bullwhip effect is an amplification of the variability of the orders placed by companies in a supply chain. This variability reduces the efficiency of supply chains, since it incurs costs due to higher inventory levels and supply chain agility reduction. Eliminating the bullwhip effect is surely simple; every company just has to order following the market demand, i.e., each company should use a lot-for-lot type of ordering policy. However, many reasons, such as inventory management, lot-sizing, and market, supply, or operation uncertainties, motivate companies not to use this strategy. Therefore, the bullwhip effect cannot be totally eliminated. However, it can be reduced by information sharing, which is the form of collaboration considered in this paper. More precisely, we study how to separate demand into original demand and adjustments. We describe two principles explaining how to use the shared information to reduce the amplification of order variability induced by lead times, which we propose as a cause of the effect. Simulations confirm the value of these two principles with regard to costs and customer service levels

PY  - 2004///
AB  - Inventory constraints, costs of lost production, safety and environmental objectives, strategies of maintenance adopted, logistics aspects of spare parts are some of the criteria taken into account, and spare parts classification is thus defined with respect to multiple attributes. In virtue of the large number of the potential operational characteristics to be considered, the decision diagram is integrated with a set of analytic hierarchy process models used to solve the various multi‐attribute decision sub‐problems at the different levels/nodes of the decision tree. An inventory policy matrix is defined to link the different classes of spare parts with the possible inventory management policies so as to identify the “best” control strategy for the spare stocks. The principles of the theory and an actual application in a company operating in the paper industry are reported in the paper.

AB  - The authors used a rational-empirical approach to construct the Student Readiness Inventory, measuring psychosocial and academic-related skill factors found to predict two important college outcomes, academic performance and retention, in a recent meta-analysis. The initial item pool was administered to 5,970 first-year college students and high school seniors to empirically validate and cross-validate the underlying factor structure. Ten first-order and 3 second-order factors were derived, partially resembling the original conceptual model. Future study is needed to explore the criterion and predictive validities of the factors constituting this inventory.

DO  - 10.1108/09600030310499277
PY  - 2003///
AB  - Increasing uncertainty of supply networks, globalization of businesses, proliferation of product variety and shortening of product life cycles have forced Indian organizations to look beyond their four walls for collaboration with supply chain partners. With a gross domestic product (GDP) of over US$474.3 biilion, the Indian industry spends 14 percent of its GDP on logistics. Considering this scenario, it is necessary to study the supply chain practices being followed by the Indian industry and to suggest areas for improving the same. This paper is based on a joint survey, covering 156 organizations, carried out by Management Development Institute, Gurgaon and KPMG India. The paper primarily focuses on the status of four major supply chain dimensions. The paper recommends that the Indian industry should align supply chain strategy with business strategy, streamline processes for supply chain integration, form partnerships for minimizing inventory and focus on infrastructure and technology deployment to build a India‐specific supply chain.

TI  - Managing product returns for competitive advantage
PY  - 2006///
AB  - Product returns have often been viewed by companies as a necessary evil, a painful process, a cost center and an area of potential customer dissatisfaction. However, say the authors, many successful organizations have realized that an effective product returns strategy can provide a number of benefits, such as improved customer service and customer knowledge, effective inventory management and product dispositioning. The authors? analysis divides returns into two categories: (1) controllable returns, which can be avoided or eliminated by actions taken by the company, and (2) uncontrollable returns, which companies can do little or nothing about in the short term. They then describe the five stages of the returns process ? receive, sort and stage, process, analyze, support ? and illustrate how companies as varied as Philips Consumer Electronics, Sierra Trading Post, Road Runner Sports, Altec Electronica Chihuahua, Sauder Woodworking and Estee Lauder minimize returns and their associated costs throughout the process by applying a variety of tactics, such as improvements in product quality, elimination of ?mispicks? and shipping errors, and implementation of programs such as vendor-managed inventory, efficient consumer response and prepostponement.

TI  - Inventory Management of Platelets in Hospitals: Optimal Inventory Policy for Perishable Products with Regular and Optional Expedited Replenishments
DO  - 10.1287/MSOM.1110.0334
PY  - 2011///
AB  - Platelets are short-life blood components used in hospital blood transfusion centers. Excluding time for transportation, testing, and arrangement, clinically transfusable platelets have a mere three-day life span. This paper analyzes a periodic review inventory system for such a perishable product under two replenishment modes. Regular orders are placed at the beginning of a cycle. Within the cycle, the manager has an option of placing an additional order, referred to as an expedited order, characterized by an order-up-to level policy. For this platelet inventory problem, we prove the existence and uniqueness of an optimal policy that minimizes the expected cost. We then derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the policy, based on which an algorithm is developed. Using real-life data, we provide a numerical illustration and a sensitivity analysis followed by extensive simulation experiments to examine the dynamics of platelet inventory management. It is shown that the optimal cost is significantly affected by demand uncertainty, lead times, seasonality, and vintage of expedited orders. Given a hospital's demand profile and the cost parameters, we are able to determine whether the hospital should order daily or every other day (i.e., adopting a combined use of regular and optional expedited orders). We also show that the analytical solution is a good approximation of the optimal policy obtained from simulation experiments, where more realistic features are incorporated. This inventory research problem can be classified as a fixed-lifetime perishable problem with dual modes of replenishments.

AB  - The rapidly developing worldwide marketplace is leading to the geographical dispersion of production, assembly and distribution operations. This paper deals with three aspects of international logistics networks: strategic, tactical and operational. The strategic level designs the logistics network, including prescribing facility locations, production technologies and plant capacities. The tactical level prescribes material flow management policies, including production levels at all plants, assembly policy, inventory levels, and lot sizes. The operational level schedules operations to assure in-time delivery of final products to customers. This paper reviews the literature that deals with strategic, tactical and operational levels and discusses relevant modelling issues.

TI  - Forecasting for inventory planning: a 50-year review
DO  - 10.1057/jors.2008.173
PY  - 2009///
AB  - Forecasting and planning for inventory management has received considerable attention from the Operational Research (OR) community over the last 50 years because of its implications for decision making, both at the strategic level of an organization and at the operational level. Many influential contributions have been made in this area, reflecting different perspectives that have evolved in divergent strands of the literature, namely: system dynamics, control theory and forecasting theory (both statistical and judgemental). Although this pluralism is healthy in terms of knowledge advancement, it also signifies the fragmentation of the OR discipline and the lack of cross-fertilization of ideas to develop more comprehensive approaches towards the resolution of the same issues. In this paper, the relevant literature is reviewed and synthesized to promote some convergence between these different approaches to inventory forecasting and planning. The review concludes with an inter-disciplinary agenda for further research.

A comprehensive methodology with different stages and approaches is presented. The method includes two main stages : inventory and quantification. The inventory stage includes four sub-stages : identification of potential geomorphosites ; qualitative assessment ; geomorphosite selection ; geomorphosite characterisation. The quantification stage includes two sub-stages : numerical assessment ; analysis of results. The interpretation of results for each of the indicators (scientific, additional, use and protection values) allows a comparison between sites and is of particular use in supporting site management decisions.

TI  - A Time-Series Framework for Supply-Chain Inventory Management
DO  - 10.1287/opre.51.2.210.12780
PY  - 2003///
AB  - We consider a supply chain in which the underlying demand process can be described in a linear state space form. Inventory is managed at various points of the chain (members), based on local information that each member observes and continuously updates. The key feature of our model is that it takes into account the ability of the members to observe subsets of the underlying state vector, and adopt their forecasting and replenishment policies accordingly. This enables us to model situations in which the members are privy to certain explanatory variables of the demand, with the latter possibly evolving according to a vector autoregressive time series. For each member, we identify an associated demand evolution model, for which we propose an adaptive inventory replenishment policy that utilizes the Kalman filter technique. We then provide a simple methodology for assessing the benefits of various types of information-sharing agreements between members of the supply chain. We also discuss inventory positioning and cost performance assessment in the supply chain. Our performance metrics and inventory target levels are usually presented in matrix forms, allowing them to accommodate a relatively large spectrum of linear demand models, and making them simple to implement. Several illustrations for possible applications of our models are provided.

TI  - RFID in textile and clothing manufacturing: technology and challenges
DO  - 10.1186/s40691-015-0034-9
PY  - 2015///
AB  - In the field of textile and clothing, radio frequency identification (RFID), which is one of the most promising technological innovations, is used in manufacturing, inventory control, warehousing, distribution, logistics, automatic object tracking and supply chain management. Various retailers and manufacturers (of clothing as well as consumer goods) such as CVS, Tesco, Prada, Benetten, Wal-mart and Procter & Gamble, are now implementing the technology and exploring the impact of the technology on their business. RFID technologies may improve the potential benefits of supply chain management through reduction of inventory losses, increase of the efficiency and speed of processes and improvement of information accuracy. The basic of success lies in understanding the technology and other features to minimize the potential problems. Although the technology existed for several years, the technological challenges and cost issues are the major hurdles for the widespread use of RFID. In this paper, the authors have addressed the technology of RFID and various applications related to inventory management, production control, retail management, brand segregation etc. in textile and clothing industry. In addition, the disadvantages, challenges and future directions of RFID technology have also been highlighted.

TI  - Global wetland inventory – current status and future priorities
DO  - 10.1071/MF99098
PY  - 1999///
AB  - This assessment is based on reviews of the extent of wetland inventory in seven regions of the world. A key conclusion is that little is still known about the extent and condition of the global wetland resource. It was not possible to make reliable overall estimates of the size of the wetland resource globally or regionally. Previous estimates range from 5.3 to 9.7 million km2 but present analyses now suggest a tentative minimum of 12.8 km2. Recommendations focus on the need for national inventory programmes and the inclusion of basic information on the location and extent of each wetland and its major ecological features as a forerunner to collecting further management-oriented information. Thus, the following core data should be collected: area and boundary, location, geomorphic setting, general description, soil characteristics, water regime, water quality, and biotic characteristics. Further, the development of standardized methods for data collection, collation and storage are called for. These should address the use of remotely sensed data and storage of information in electronic formats, including Geographic Information Systems and recording key information in a meta-database. Habitats of priority for future inventory are seagrasses, coral reefs, salt marshes and coastal flats, mangroves, arid-zone wetlands, peatlands, rivers and streams, and artificial wetlands.

TI  - Inventory Management in Humanitarian Operations: Impact of Amount, Schedule, and Uncertainty in Funding
DO  - 10.1287/msom.2014.0497
PY  - 2014///
AB  - Funding for humanitarian operations in the global health sector is highly variable and unpredictable. We study the problem of managing inventory in the presence of funding constraints over a finite planning period. Our goal is to determine the optimal procurement policy given the complexities associated with funding and also to analyze the impact of funding amount, funding schedule, and uncertainty around the funding timing on operations. We use a multiperiod stochastic inventory model with financial constraints and demonstrate that despite the funding complexities, the optimal replenishment policy is a state-independent policy that can be easily implemented. We also provide analytical results and several insights based on our computational study regarding the effect of funding timing uncertainty and variability on the operating costs and fill rates. Among other results, we find that receiving funding early is beneficial in underfinanced systems while avoiding funding delays is critical in fully financed systems. Our analysis also indicates that receiving less overall funding in a timely manner might actually be better than delayed full funding.

TI  - Operations management in multi-channel retailing: an exploratory study
DO  - 10.1007/S12063-015-0101-9
PY  - 2015///
AB  - Multi-channel (MC) shopping is revolutionizing retail operations. For traditional retailers, the growing importance of online sales means creating new supply chain models. This requires a solid understanding of the operations processes. Current literature on MC management focuses on customer perspectives, but only touches on the operational aspects. The primary goal of this study is therefore to give a comprehensive overview of the operations structures of MC retailing, identify the operations systems in use and analyze their planning interdependencies. We identify network design, inventory management, warehouse operations and capacity management as the areas of MC operations planning. Their planning interdependencies are investigated. We analyze the different MC networks and the associated inventory management approaches as well as the various design concepts in warehouse operations. The efficiency of integrating warehouse operations is the core lever for integrated MC operations. While inventory pooling favors integrated networks, channel-specific operational challenges are a reason to simplify structures and operate separate networks. Specific operational design options (e.g., in picking and scheduling) are identified to optimally complement the network design selected. Company examples also give an idea of how to efficiently design the coordination of on- and offline logistics. Retailers can gain important insights into how to further develop their systems. We used an explorative approach to identify structures and processes in a relatively new research area. We questioned 43 executives from 33 different European-based leading companies in MC retailing in semi-structured, face-to-face interviews. This paper describes the results of what is currently the largest study on MC operations.

DO  - 10.1108/13598541111155857
PY  - 2011///
AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to explore the utility of the manufacturing biased supply chain operations reference (SCOR) tool in services and develops a reference model for use in service organisations.Design/methodology/approach – Services are considered as supply chain processes that are balanced around the capacity of the firm through the upstream sourcing processes. Empirical research is undertaken to model the design, creation and delivery processes of a management consultancy as a supply chain and to identify the potential application and benefits of the tool in a service context.Findings – The developed model conceptualises the capacity of service firms as a resource inventory to build a service offering. This inventory‐capacity duality that describes a service firm's capabilities is applicable across a wide spectrum of the service sector. Six major processes for the design and management of service supply chains are identified: plan, source, develop, adapt, operate, and recover.Research limitations/i...

TI  - The Impact of Inventory Management on Stock-Outs of Essential Drugs in Sub-Saharan Africa: Secondary Analysis of a Field Experiment in Zambia
DO  - 10.1371/journal.pone.0156026
PY  - 2016///
AB  - Objective To characterize the impact of widespread inventory management policies on stock-outs of essential drugs in Zambia’s health clinics and develop related recommendations. Methods Daily clinic storeroom stock levels of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) products in 2009–2010 were captured in 145 facilities through photography and manual transcription of paper forms, then used to determine historical stock-out levels and estimate demand patterns. Delivery lead-times and estimates of monthly facility accessibility were obtained through worker surveys. A simulation model was constructed and validated for predictive accuracy against historical stock-outs, then used to evaluate various changes potentially affecting product availability. Findings While almost no stock-outs of AL products were observed during Q4 2009 consistent with primary analysis, up to 30% of surveyed facilities stocked out of some AL product during Q1 2010 despite ample inventory being simultaneously available at the national warehouse. Simulation experiments closely reproduced these results and linked them to the use of average past monthly issues and failure to capture lead-time variability in current inventory control policies. Several inventory policy enhancements currently recommended by USAID | DELIVER were found to have limited impact on product availability. Conclusions Inventory control policies widely recommended and used for distributing medicines in sub-Saharan Africa directly account for a substantial fraction of stock-outs observed in common situations involving demand seasonality and facility access interruptions. Developing central capabilities in peripheral demand forecasting and inventory control is critical. More rigorous independent peer-reviewed research on pharmaceutical supply chain management in low-income countries is needed.

TI  - Overbooking with Substitutable Inventory Classes
DO  - 10.1287/opre.1030.0079
PY  - 2004///
AB  - This paper considers an overbooking problem with multiple reservation and inventory classes, in which the multiple inventory classes may be used as substitutes to satisfy the demand of a given reservation class (perhaps at a cost). The problem is to jointly determine overbooking levels for the reservation classes, taking into account the substitution options. Such problems arise in a variety of revenue management contexts, including multicabin aircraft, back-to-back scheduled flights on the same leg, hotels with multiple room types, and mixed-vehicle car rental fleets. We model this problem as a two-period optimization problem. In the first period, reservations are accepted given only probabilistic knowledge of cancellations. In the second period, cancellations are realized and surviving customers are assigned to the various inventory classes to maximize the net benefit of assignments (e.g., minimize penalties). For this formulation, we show that the expected revenue function is submodular in the overbooking levels, which implies the natural property that the optimal overbooking level in one reservation class decreases with the number of reservations held in the other reservation classes. We then propose a stochastic gradient algorithm to find the joint optimal overbooking levels. We compare the decisions of the model to those produced by more naive heuristics on some examples motivated by airline applications. The results show that accounting for substitution when setting overbooking levels has a small, but still significant, impact on revenues and costs.

DO  - 10.1093/RFS/9.3.953
PY  - 1996///
AB  - We use futures transaction data to investigate cross-sectional relationships between market-maker inventory positions and trade activity. The investigation documents strongly that traders control inventory throughout the trading day. Despite this evidence of inventory management, typical inventory control models are contradicted by our data. These inventory models predict that market-maker reservation prices are negatively influenced by inventory. Surprisingly, our evidence shows, as a strong and consistent empirical regularity, that correlations between inventory and reservation prices are positive. We interpret the evidence as consistent with active position taking by futures market floor traders.

AB  - Electronic commerce continues to see phenomenal growth, but so far most e-commerce development involves wired infrastructures. The authors believe emerging wireless and mobile networks will provide new avenues for growth, creating new opportunities in mobile commerce. According to the GartnerGroup, a market research firm, by 2004 at least 40 percent of consumer-to-business e-commerce will come from smart phones using the wireless application protocol (WAP). Based on a study by the Wireless Data and Computing Service, a division of Strategy Analytics, the annual mobile commerce market may rise to $200 billion by 2004. The authors provide a mobile commerce framework to illustrate potential applications such as mobile inventory management, product location and search, proactive service management, and mobile entertainment. They also describe the wireless user and networking infrastructure, emerging W3C standards, and the open and global WAP specification.

PY  - 2007///
AB  - The Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR) is one of the most widely used social desirability scales. The authors conducted a reliability generalization study to examine the typical reliability coefficients of BIDR scores and explored factors that explained the variability of reliability estimates across studies. The results indicated that the overall BIDR scale produced scores that were adequately reliable. The mean score reliability estimates for the two subscales, Self-Deception Enhancement and Impression Management, were not satisfactory. In addition, although a number of study characteristics were statistically significantly related to reliability estimates, they accounted for only a small portion of the overall variability in reliability estimates. The results of these findings and their implications are also discussed.

TI  - Economics of reservoir sedimentation and sustainable management of dams.
DO  - 10.1006/JEMA.2000.0392
PY  - 2001///
AB  - Accepted practice has been to design and operate reservoirs to fill with sediment, generating benefits from remaining storage over a finite period of time. The consequences of sedimentation and project abandonment are left to the future. This 'future' has already arrived for many existing reservoirs and most others will eventually experience a similar fate, thereby imposing substantial costs on society. Such costs could be avoided if sedimentation was minimized and dams were allowed to live forever. The fact that the world's inventory of suitable reservoir sites is limited provides an additional reason for encouraging the sustainable management of dams. This paper provides a framework for assessing the economic feasibility of sediment management strategies that would allow the life of dams to be prolonged indefinitely. Even if reduced accumulation or removal of sediment is technically possible, its economic viability is likely to depend on physical, hydrological and financial parameters. The model presented incorporates such factors and allows a characterization of conditions under which sustainable management would be desirable. The empirical implementation of the model draws upon the substantial amount of technical information available. We analyze the sustainability of reservoirs, with a focus on the trade-off between such sustainability and the short to medium term benefits which a reservoir is expected to produce. The results show that, for a very wide range of realistic parameter values, sustainable management of reservoirs is economically more desirable than the prevailing practice of forcing a finite reservoir life through excessive sediment accumulation.

DO  - 10.1080/0740817X.2015.1019162
PY  - 2015///
AB  - Simulation optimization is increasingly popular for solving complicated and mathematically intractable business problems. Focusing on academic articles published between 1998 and 2013, the present survey aims to unveil the extent to which simulation optimization has been used to solve practical inventory problems (as opposed to small, theoretical “toy problem”), and to detect any trends that might have arisen (e.g., popular topics, effective simulation optimization methods, frequently studied inventory system structures). We find that metaheuristics (especially genetic algorithms) and methods that combine several simulation optimization techniques are the most popular. The resulting categorizations provide a useful overview for researchers studying complex inventory management problems, by providing detailed information on the inventory system characteristics and the employed simulation optimization techniques, highlighting articles that involve stochastic constraints (e.g., expected fill rate constraints) or that employ a robust simulation optimization approach. Finally, in highlighting both trends and gaps in the research field, this review suggests avenues for further research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The challenge of production and inventory management for blood platelets (PLTs) is the requirement to meet highly uncertain demands. Shortages are to be minimized, if not to be avoided at all. Overproduction, in turn, leads to high levels of outdating as PLTs have a limited “shelf life.” Outdating is to be minimized for ethical and cost reasons.

TI  - The Supply Chain Management Game for the 2007 Trading Agent Competition
PY  - 2004///
AB  - This is the specification for the Trading Agent Competition – Supply Chain Management Game for 2007 (TAC SCM-07). Agents are simulations of small manufacturers, who must compete with each other for both supplies and customers, and manage inventories and production facilities. Based on the positive experience with the 2006 trading agent competition, no technical changes have been made to the game for 2007. However, the position on the use of external information by the agents (i.e. that provided by the game viewer or the game logs) has been clarified. Using such information, either manually or automatically, is now regarded as external ‘tuning’ of the agent. As such, according to the existing competition rules, it is forbidden within any specific round during of finals of the competition. The research reported in this paper was funded in part by the National Science Foundation under ITR Grant 0205435.

TI  - Assessing Management Regimes in Transboundary River Basins: Do They Support Adaptive Management?
DO  - 10.5751/ES-02385-130114
PY  - 2008///
AB  - River basin management is faced with complex problems that are characterized by uncertainty and change. In transboundary river basins, historical, legal, and cultural differences add to the complexity. The literature on adaptive management gives several suggestions for handling this complexity. It recognizes the importance of management regimes as enabling or limiting adaptive management, but there is no comprehensive overview of regime features that support adaptive management. This paper presents such an overview, focused on transboundary river basin management. It inventories the features that have been claimed to be central to effective transboundary river basin management and refines them using adaptive management literature. It then collates these features into a framework describing actor networks, policy processes, information management, and legal and financial aspects. Subsequently, this framework is applied to the Orange and Rhine basins. The paper concludes that the framework provides a consistent and comprehensive perspective on transboundary river basin management regimes, and can be used for assessing their capacity to support adaptive management.

TI  - Identifying urban sources as cause of elevated grass pollen concentrations using GIS and remote sensing
DO  - 10.5194/BG-10-541-2013
PY  - 2012///
AB  - We examine here the hypothesis that during flowering, the grass pollen concentrations at a specific site reflect the distribution of grass pollen sources within a few kilometres of this site.We perform this analysis on data from a measurement campaign in the city of Aarhus (Denmark) using three pollen traps and by comparing these observations with a novel inventory of grass pollen sources. The source inventory is based on a new methodology developed for urbanscale grass pollen sources. The new methodology is believed to be generally applicable for the European area, as it relies on commonly available remote sensing data combined with management information for local grass areas. The inventory has identified a number of grass pollen source areas present within the city domain. The comparison of the measured pollen concentrations with the inventory shows that the atmospheric concentrations of grass pollen in the urban zone reflect the source areas identified in the inventory, and that the pollen sources that are found to affect the pollen levels are located near or within the city domain. The results also show that during days with peak levels of pollen concentrations there is no correlation between the three urban traps and an operational trap located just 60 km away. This finding suggests that during intense flowering, the grass pollen concentration mirrors the local source distribution and is thus a local-scale phenomenon. Model simulations aimed at assessing population exposure to pollen levels are therefore recommended to take into account both local sources and local atmospheric transport, and not to rely only on describing regional to long-range transport of pollen. The derived pollen source inventory can be entered into local-scale atmospheric transport models in combination with other components that simulate pollen release in order to calculate urban-scale variations in the grass pollen load. The gridded inventory with a resolution of 14m is therefore made available as supplementary material to this paper, and the verifying grass pollen observations are additionally available in tabular form.

TI  - Landscape-scale parameterization of a tree-level forest growth model: a k-nearest neighbor imputation approach incorporating LiDAR data
DO  - 10.1139/X09-183
PY  - 2010///
AB  - Sustainable forest management requires timely, detailed forest inventory data across large areas, which is difficult to obtain via traditional forest inventory techniques. This study evaluated k-nearest neighbor imputation models incorporating LiDAR data to predict tree-level inventory data (individual tree height, diameter at breast height, and species) across a 12 100 ha study area in northeastern Oregon, USA. The primary objective was to provide spatially explicit data to parameterize the Forest Vegetation Simulator, a tree-level forest growth model. The final imputation model utilized LiDAR-derived height measurements and topographic variables to spatially predict tree-level forest inventory data. When compared with an independent data set, the accuracy of forest inventory metrics was high; the root mean square difference of imputed basal area and stem volume estimates were 5 m2·ha–1 and 16 m3·ha–1, respectively. However, the error of imputed forest inventory metrics incorporating small trees (e.g., q...

TI  - Decomposition of a Combined Inventory and Time Constrained Ship Routing Problem
DO  - 10.1287/trsc.33.1.3
PY  - 1999///
AB  - In contrast to vehicle routing problems, little work has been done in ship routing and scheduling, although large benefits may be expected from improving this scheduling process. We will present a real ship planning problem, which is a combined inventory management problem anda routing problem with time windows. A fleet of ships transports a single product (ammonia) between production and consumption harbors. The quantities loaded and discharged are determined by the production rates of the harbors, possible stock levels, and the actual ship visiting the harbor. We describe the real problem and the underlying mathematical model. To decompose this model, we discuss some model adjustments. Then, the problem can be solved by a DantzigÂ Wolfe decomposition approach including both ship routing subproblems and inventory management subproblems. The overall problem is solved by branch-and-bound. Our computational results indicate that the proposed method works for the real planning problem.

TI  - Enhancing ecosystem management through social-ecological inventories: lessons from Kristianstads Vattenrike, Sweden
DO  - 10.1017/S0376892907003876
PY  - 2007///
AB  - Environmental policy increasingly emphasizes involvement of local users and land owners in ecosystem management, but conservation planning is still largely a bureaucratic-scientific endeavour of identifying biological values for protection. Neither biological inventories nor stakeholder analyses, that tend to focus on conflicting interests, capture human resources in the landscape or the social structures and processes underlying biological conservation values. Social-ecological inventories are therefore proposed during the preparation phase of conservation projects as a means to identify people with ecosystem knowledge that practise ecosystem management. The method presented here focuses on local steward groups acting outside official management plans. In a social-ecological inventory of a river basin of southern Sweden, local steward groups, their ecosystem management activities, motives and links to other actors involved in ecosystem management were identified through interviews, participatory observations and a review of documents and other written material. Several hundred active local stewards were organized in 10 local steward groups that managed and monitored a range of ecosystem services at different spatial scales. Contributions of local stewards included on-site ecosystem management, long-term and detailed monitoring of species and ecosystem dynamics, local ecological knowledge, public support for ecosystem management and specialized networks. Two conservation projects are used to illustrate how local steward groups came together in multi-level networks and collaborated around specific conservation issues. The projects have been linked to ecosystem management at the landscape level through a flexible municipality organization, the Ecomuseum Kristianstads Vattenrike (EKV). EKV has acted as a ‘bridging organization’, coordinating and connecting many of the local steward groups to organizations and institutions at other levels. The process has been guided by social capital and shared visions for the whole landscape. The study shows that ecosystem management likely relies on multi-level collaboration and social-ecological inventories may help identify actors that are fundamental in such management systems. Social-ecological inventories should be employed in any attempt to develop and implement ecosystem management.

AB  - The chapter starts with a strategic overview of the blood banking supply chain. We then proceed to ask and answer questions concerning (i) the blood banking functions that should be performed and at what locations, (ii) which donor areas and transfusion services should be assigned to which community blood centers, (iii) how many community blood centers should be in a region, (iv) where they should be located and (v) how supply and demand should be coordinated. Then the many tactical operational issues involved in collecting blood, producing multiple products, setting and controlling inventory levels, allocating blood to hospitals, delivery to multiple sites, and making optimal decisions about issuing, crossmatching, and crossmatch releasing blood and blood products are presented. The chapter concludes with areas for future research.

TI  - Dynamic Inventory Management with Learning About the Demand Distribution and Substitution Probability
DO  - 10.1287/msom.1070.0165
PY  - 2008///
AB  - Awell-known result in the Bayesian inventory management literature is: If lost sales are not observed, the Bayesian optimal inventory level is larger than the myopic inventory level (one should “stock more” to learn about the demand distribution). This result has been proven in other studies under the assumption that inventory is perishable, so the myopic inventory level is equal to the Bayesian optimal inventory level with observed lost sales. We break that equivalence by considering nonperishable inventory. We prove that with nonperishable inventory, the famous “stock more” result is often reversed to “stock less,” in that the Bayesian optimal inventory level with unobserved lost sales is lower than the myopic inventory level. We also prove that making lost sales unobservable increases the Bayesian optimal inventory level; in this specific sense, the famous “stock more” result of other studies generalizes to the case of nonperishable inventory. When the product is out of stock, a customer may accept a substitute or choose not to purchase. We incorporate learning about the probability of substitution. This reduces the Bayesian optimal inventory level in the case that lost sales are observed. Reducing the inventory level has two beneficial effects: to observe and learn more about customer substitution behavior and (for a nonperishable product) to reduce the probability of overstocking in subsequent periods. Finally, for a capacitated production-inventory system under continuous review, we derive maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of the demand rate and probability that customers will wait for the product. (Accepting a raincheck for delivery at some later time is a common type of substitution.) We investigate how the choice of base-stock level and production rate affect the convergence rate of these MLEs. The results reinforce those for the Bayesian, uncapacitated, periodic review system.

TI  - Self‐efficacy for coping with cancer: revision of the Cancer Behavior Inventory (version 2.0)
DO  - 10.1002/PON.511
PY  - 2001///
AB  - The Cancer Behavior Inventory (CBI), a measure of self‐efficacy for coping with cancer, was revised by adding a new stress management scale and reducing its length from 43 to 33 items. The 33‐item CBI was administered to 280 cancer patients. A principal factors analysis with varimax rotation yielded the hypothesized seven factors (αs in parentheses): (1) maintenance of activity and independence (α=0.86), (2) seeking and understanding medical information (α=0.88), (3) stress management (α=0.86), (4) coping with treatment‐related side‐effects (α=0.82), (5) accepting cancer/maintaining positive attitude (α=0.86), (6) affective regulation (α=0.81), and (7) seeking support (α=0.80). The α for the entire CBI was 0.94, the test‐retest (1 week) reliability coefficient was 0.74, and correlations with measures of quality of life and coping supported its validity. The CBI may be useful to researchers and clinicians and can be integrated into a self‐regulation model of coping. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

PY  - 2002///
AB  - Three hundred 9th-graders and their best friends participated in this short-term longitudinal study. Confirmatory factor analysis of the Parental Management of Peers Inventory (N. Mounts, 2000) suggested that the 4-factor structure provided a good fit to the data. Significant differences in adolescents' perceptions of parental management of peers occurred across 4 parenting style groups. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relation among 5 aspects of parental management of peers and adolescents' Time 1 drug use, friends' Time 1 drug use, and adolescents' Time 2 drug use. The parental management styles of monitoring, guiding, prohibiting, and supporting all had significant paths in the model, whereas neutrality was not significant. Multiple group comparisons were used to examine whether parenting style moderates the relation between parental management of peers and the drug use outcomes. Parenting style functioned as a moderator for 7 of the paths in the model.

TI  - Relationship Between Working Capital Management And Profitability In Brazilian Listed Companies
PY  - 2011///
AB  - To overcome competition in a very complex environment, few companies have been able to use the optimization of working capital as a real competitive advantage to leverage profit. The objectives of this article are twofold: a) to investigate if there is any difference between corporate profitability and working capital management in two separate groups of companies: working capital intensive and fixed capital intensive; b) to identify the variables that most affect profitability. The profitability was measured in three different ways: return on sales (ROS), on asset (ROA) and on equity (ROE). The independent variables used are cash conversion efficiency, debt ratio, days of working capital, days receivable and days inventory. Two samples were obtained consisting of 16 Brazilian listed companies in each group for the period 2005-2009. Multiple linear regression has identified that, as far as ROS and ROA are concerned, to manage working capital properly is equally relevant for the two groups of companies. However the impact of debt ratio and days of working capital are relevant in the company profitability in the fixed capital group as opposed to the working capital group. From ANOVA it is evident that days inventory has negative relationship with ROS and ROA but has no statistical evidence in ROE improvement in working capital intensive group. It has also identified days of working capital as the variable that influences ROS in the second group (positive relationship) while debt ratio is the only variable that affects ROA (negative relationship). These results show that regardless the type of company, whether working capital or fixed capital intensive, managing working capital properly is equally important. Moreover, managing inventory as well as cash conversion efficiency to an optimum level will yield more profit in the working capital intensive type of company, while two other different variables create more profit in the fixed capital intensive type of company.

TI  - Control of Dividends, Capital Subscriptions, and Physical Inventories
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.1120.1629
PY  - 2013///
AB  - Manufacturers are faced with the financial and physical task of managing interrelated flows of material and cash. Material needs capital, and the sale of finished goods contributes to cash reserves. We present and study a dynamic model of managerial decisions in a manufacturing firm in which inventory and financial decisions interact and are coordinated in the presence of demand uncertainty, financial constraints, and a risk of default. The criterion is to maximize the expected present value of dividends net of capital subscriptions. We contrast coordination with the usual decentralized separation of operational and financial decisions, and give an example in which the relative financial value of coordination can be made unboundedly large. We establish conditions which imply that the optimal base-stock inventory level and financial decision variables are nondecreasing functions of the levels of inventory and retained earnings. We show that some important attributes of an optimal policy remain the same regardless of whether default precipitates Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The optimal policy is myopic, and if the inventory-related cost and default penalty (in the case of Chapter 11 bankruptcy) are piece-wise linear, the optimal coordinated policy is characterized with simple formulas. The effect of inventory on the risk and cost of default causes the target levels of inventory and residual retained earnings to be different in a coordinated dividend-maximizing firm than in one which decentralizes financial and operational decisions and makes the latter decisions to maximize profit. ∗Lode Li, Yale School of Management, Box 208200, New Haven, CT 06520-8200.

Sobel, Weatherhead School of Management, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106-7235 1 OPERATIONS AND FINANCE 1 1 Operations and Finance Business organizations are faced with the financial and physical task of managing flows of material and cash. In large firms, the task is decentralized into separate functional responsibilities, although the flows are interrelated because material needs capital and the sale of finished goods contributes to cash reserves. The same dichotomy into operations and finance occurs in management education and research. Although decentralization in professional practice was obligatory in the absence of enterprise-wide information systems, technology has advanced and in many firms it is technically feasible to coordinate financial and operational decisions. This paper contributes to understanding what coordination would entail and to determining its financial value. Ease of analysis and concentration on special function are two reasons in practice to separate operational and financial decisions. In practice, the production manager has much to learn about sales, production/procurement, and inventories without being concerned directly with finance. But it is a practical question to decide when the interaction between finance and operations can be completely ignored, as a good enough approximation to reality, or when it is sufficiently important that the functions should be coordinated. Unlike some large firms, many small growing firms are severely cash constrained and could not survive without coordinating financial and operational decisions. The large literature on asset pricing in financial economics argues that the primary measure of the financial value of an investor-owned firm is the expected present value of the time stream of its dividends (cf. Lucas (1973), Brodie, Kane and Marcus (1995, page 326), and Cochrane (2001)), namely its EPV. One may argue that operations models should not use this criterion due to the ModiglianiMiller Theorem (Modigliani and Miller, 1958) which is predicated on perfect markets. However, many firms do not operate in perfect markets and are influenced by the specter of bankruptcy. This is particularly true of those which are small and entrepreneurial. Our modeling is motivated by firms such as these where prescriptions for operating behavior can be ineffective if they overlook the interaction of financial and operational decisions. Therefore, we use the EPV criterion net of capital subscriptions. In contrast, the research methodologies and qualitative results in inventory theory respond to cost and/or profit criteria. There is a potential for liquidity crises in the firm facing production/procurement lags, uncertain 1 OPERATIONS AND FINANCE 2 demand and financial constraints. In young firms, as much as the stockholders might like to see their dividends flow and grow, the payouts may sometimes be negative in the sense that the stockholders may be called for capital subscriptions, namely more cash to keep the enterprise solvent. At first, we consider this possibility by allowing the dividends to be negative. The model which we define and analyze in Sections 2, 3, and 4 does not constrain dividends to be nonnegative. One may interpret a negative dividend for a small or medium-sized business as an action by the owners to subscribe additional capital. So, the model corresponds to a small or medium-sized business whose owners may be obliged to subscribe additional capital. Later, in §6, we impose a nonnegativity constraint on dividends. We make two kinds of contributions in highly stylized settings. First, we characterize optimal policies for coordinating operational and financial decisions. Second, we characterize the market value of a firm that adopts such policies. The financial value of coordination is the difference between the market value under coordination and the market value of a corresponding firm which continues to decentralize its decisions. 1.1 Background Literature Although there is a well developed literature on models of production and inventory systems (cf. Graves, Rinnoy Kan, and Zipkin (1993)), until recently, only a few models of operational decisions included financial considerations. An early analysis of financial considerations is based on a model of the dynamics of the growth of a dividend-paying non-financial firm as a controlled random walk between a reflecting and an absorbing barrier (Shubik and Thompson, 1959). The reflecting barrier is created by dividend payments and the absorbing barrier by bankruptcy conditions which put the firm out of business. The separation of ownership and management in a game of economic survival provides the mathematical structure to reflect the potential differences in goals of management and ownership; in particular concerning the roles of dividends and bankruptcy. The model below reflects the strategic aspects of the tradeoffs between bankruptcy and the paying of dividends. Alternatively, if the firm is penalized by an insolvency, but is in a position to continue to operate, this too can be modeled as a reflecting barrier. See Radner and Shepp (1996) for recent work of this kind. Hadley and Whitin (1963) and Sherbrooke (1968) are early papers on inventory management with budgetary 1 OPERATIONS AND FINANCE 3 constraints. The treatment of the maintenance of cash safety levels as an inventory control problem (cf. Porteus (1972) and Shubik and Sobel (1992)) is another research connection between operations and finance. Most of the fusion of operational and financial considerations is recent in origin. A series of papers model operational decisions in the presence of foreign exchange exposure (e.g., Kogut and Kulatilaka (1994), Huchzermeier and Cohen (1996), Dasu and Li (1997), Aytekin and Birge (2004), and Dong et al. (2006)). Papers in another series analyze capacity-expansion problems with financial constraints (e.g., Birge (2000), Van Mieghem (2003), and Babich and Sobel (2004)) and use approaches similar to ours. Some recent work on the coordination of operational and financial decisions can be partitioned according to whether or not the models and criteria are influenced by the capital structure of the firm. Perhaps earliest among the papers that are orthogonal to capital structure considerations are Archibald et al. (2002) who optimize the probability of survival of a growing firm which manages an inventory, and Buzacott and Zhang (2003) who model a growing manufacturer which finances production both with loans secured by inventory and with unsecured loans. The latter paper demonstrates the importance of jointly considering production and financing decisions in a dynamic but deterministic setting and proposes a single-period newsvendor model to examine the incentives for a lender and a borrower to engage in asset-based financing. Capital structure plays a role in the static model that is essentially common to Xu and Birge (2004), Xu and Birge (2005), and Dada and Hu (2008). In these papers, a financially constrained firm coordinates its operating decisions and short-term borrowing. Xu and Birge (2004), assuming that the creditor is non-strategic, comment that bankruptcy costs remove the firm from the Modigaliani-Miller world. As a result, the firm’s borrowing capacity is limited, and it may have to produce less than the unconstrained optimum. Comparative statics implies that the firm’s optimal production quantity decreases as its debt increases. The authors conclude that “a low-margin company should [select] a conservative output level and an aggressive financial decision, while [a] high-margin company” should do the opposite. Xu and Birge (2005) numerically examine the dependence of the value of the firm on production unit cost and debt-equity ratio, and then compare their results with market data. They find that 1 OPERATIONS AND FINANCE 4 the model predicts lower debt-equity ratios than the data exhibit, and they attribute this difference to the absence of long-term debt in the model. They show that a low-margin producer faces higher agency costs than a high-margin one. Dada and Hu (2008) assume that the creditor is strategic and, using

TI  - Optimal Airline Seat Allocation with Fare Classes Nested by Origins and Destinations
DO  - 10.1287/trsc.24.3.193
PY  - 1990///
AB  - Previous research in the optimal allocation of airline seats has followed one of two themes: marginal seat revenue or mathematical programming. Both approaches capture important elements of the revenue management problem. The marginal seat revenue approach accounts for the “nesting” of fare classes in computer reservation systems, but can only control seat inventory by bookings on legs. The mathematical programming approach will handle realistically large problems and will account for multiple origin–destination itineraries and side constraints, but it does not account for fare class nesting in the reservation systems. This paper combines both approaches by developing equations to find the optimal allocation of seats when fare classes are nested on an origin–destination itinerary and the inventory is not shared among origin–destinations. These results are applicable to seat allocation in certain reservations systems, point-of-sale control, and acceptance of groups over their entire itinerary. A special case of the analysis produces the optimal booking limits for leg-based seat allocation with nested fare classes.

TI  - Clickstream Data and Inventory Management: Model and Empirical Analysis
DO  - 10.1111/POMS.12046
PY  - 2014///
AB  - We consider firms that feature their products on the Internet but take orders offline. Click and order data are disjoint on such non-transactional websites, and their matching is error-prone. Yet, their time separation may allow the firm to react and improve its tactical planning. We introduce a dynamic decision support model that augments the classic inventory planning model with additional clickstream state variables. Using a novel data set of matched online clickstream and offline purchasing data, we identify statistically significant clickstream variables and empirically investigate the value of clickstream tracking on non-transactional websites to improve inventory management. We show that the noisy clickstream data is statistically significant to predict the propensity, amount, and timing of offline orders. A counterfactual analysis shows that using the demand information extracted from the clickstream data can reduce the inventory holding and backordering cost by 3% to 5% in our data set.

DO  - 10.1111/POMS.12661
PY  - 2017///
AB  - Cooperation among humanitarian organizations has attracted increasing attention to enhance effectiveness and efficiency of relief supply chains. Our research focuses on horizontal cooperation in inventory management which is currently implemented in the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD) network. The present work follows a two-step research approach, which involves collection of empirical data and quantitative modeling to examine and overcome the coordination challenges of the network. Our interviews with members of the network identified several managerial issues for sustainable cooperative inventory management that the UNHRD network pursues. Using a newsvendor model in the context of non-cooperative game theory, our research has explored member humanitarian organizations' incentive of joining the network, a coordination mechanism which achieves system optimality, and impacts of members' decisions about stock rationing. Our results indicate that behaviors of member HOs do not necessarily align with the UNHRD's expectation. Our results suggest that for system optimality, a system coordinator should carefully assess the circumstances, including demand coefficient and stock rationing. Our research also proposes a policy priority for the first-best system optimal inventory management.

TI  - Optimization of mixed fare structures: Theory and applications
DO  - 10.1057/RPM.2009.18
PY  - 2010///
AB  - This paper develops a theory for optimizing revenue through seat inventory control that can be applied in a variety of airline fare structures, including those with less restricted and fully undifferentiated fare products that have become more common in the recent past. We describe an approach to transform the fares and the demand of a general discrete choice model to an equivalent independent demand model. The transformation and resulting fare adjustment approach is valid for both static and dynamic optimization and extends to network revenue management applications. This transformation allows the continued use of the optimization algorithms and seat inventory control mechanisms of traditional revenue management systems, developed more than two decades ago under the assumption of independent demands for fare classes.

TI  - A decision-making framework for managing maintenance spare parts
DO  - 10.1080/09537280802034471
PY  - 2008///
AB  - Despite the huge body of academic literature on inventory management of maintenance spare parts, few companies seem to deliberately use the proper approaches and tools for a factual and quantitative assessment. Detaining or not stocks of a spare item, deciding upon the right level of inventory, forecasting its sporadic consumption are just some of the evidences of the complexity and criticality underlying the daily decisions the management of a company has to undertake. The objective of the paper is to provide a stepwise decision-making path in order to orienteer an industrial manager on how to pragmatically handle the management of maintenance spare parts in a company. The framework is structured into five sequential steps: part coding, part classification, part demand forecasting, stock management policy and policy test and validation. Its applicability is demonstrated by making use of a real business case where it has been successfully adopted.

DO  - 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1441(200001/03)7:1<3::AID-KPM72>3.0.CO;2-0
PY  - 2000///
AB  - One of the critical first steps in the knowledge management area is to conduct a knowledge audit. Some people view the knowledge audit as being the business needs assessment, cultural assessment, and an examination of what knowledge is needed, available, missing, applied, and contained. In the same manner that a manufacturing company will first inventory its physical assets, an aspiring ‘knowledge organization’ should also inventory its intellectual capital assets. This paper will focus on the third strand of the knowledge audit described above, namely determining what knowledge is needed, what is available and missing, who needs this knowledge, and how it will be applied. Then, a case study will be discussed where the knowledge audit instrument was used. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Changes in Working Capital of Small Firms in Relation to Changes in Economic Activity
DO  - 10.1108/19355181199500015
PY  - 1995///
AB  - This paper studies how the working capital position of small firms responds to changes in the level of economic activity. Fifty small firms were studied for the time period 1980‐1991. The findings from this study showed that liquidity increased slightly for these firms during economic expansion with no noticeable change in liquidity during economic slowdowns. Their investment in working capital, as measured by the inventory to total assets and current assets to total assets ratios, were relatively stable over the time period of this study.Findings suggest that working capital management practices of small firms in response to changes in economic activity do not follow commonly held expectations.

TI  - The impact of inventory management practice on firms’ competitiveness and organizational performance: Empirical evidence from micro and small enterprises in Ethiopia
DO  - 10.1080/23311975.2018.1503219
PY  - 2018///
AB  - Abstract This study aimed to empirically examine the impact of inventory management practice on firms’ competitiveness and organizational performance. Data for the study were collected from 188 micro and small enterprises (MSEs) operating in the manufacturing sub-sector and the relationships and hypothesis proposed in the conceptual framework were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results indicate that higher levels of inventory management practice can lead to an enhanced competitive advantage and improved organizational performance. Also, competitive advantage can have a direct, positive impact on organizational performance. Therefore, it is recommended that policy makers, universities, NGOs and any concerned party who are engaged in supporting of MSEs need to work on providing the necessary training and resource to promote the inventory management practice of MSEs which will result in increasing their competitiveness and organizational performance. That would enhance their contribution to the economic development of the country. Note that, the conclusion obtained from this study may not be used to generalize to large and medium scale as well as overall sectors since its focus is only from the MSEs’ manufacturing sub-sector points of view.

DO  - 10.1111/J.1745-6606.2001.TB00117.X
PY  - 2001///
AB  - This study investigates Chinese consumers' decision-making styles. The Consumer Style Inventory (CSI) is administered to 387 adult consumers in China. Both an exploratory factor analysis and a confirmatory factor analysis are adopted to validate the CSI inventory. This results in an eighteen-item and seven-factor solution. Findings indicate that five decision-making styles are valid and reliable in Chinese culture: perfectionistic, novelty-fashion conscious, recreational, price conscious, and confused by overchoice. Cluster analysis is employed to identify prominent market segments. Based on the findings, three segments are formed: trendy and perfectionistic consumer, traditional and pragmatic consumer, as well as confused by overchoice consumer. Marketing and management implications are discussed.

PY  - 2010///
AB  - Food retail inventory management faces major challenges by uncertain demand, perishability, and high customer service level requirements. In this paper, we present a method to determine dynamic order quantities for perishable products with limited shelf-life, positive lead time, FIFO or LIFO issuing policy, and multiple service level constraints. In a numerical study, we illustrate the superiority of the proposed method over commonly suggested order-up-to-policies. We show that a constant-order policy might provide good results under stationary demand, short shelf-life, and LIFO inventory depletion.

DO  - 10.1109/HICSS.2001.927208
PY  - 2001///
AB  - We envision many new e-commerce applications will be possible and significantly benefit from emerging wireless and mobile networks. These applications can collectively be termed wireless e-commerce or mobile commerce. To allow designers, developers, and researchers to strategize and effectively implement mobile commerce applications, we propose a 4-level integrated framework for mobile commerce. Since there are potentially an unlimited number of mobile commerce applications we only identify a few important classes of applications such as mobile financial applications, mobile advertising, mobile inventory management, proactive service management, product location and search, and wireless re-engineering. We also address the networking requirements of these applications and discuss how these requirements can be supported by existing and emerging wireless networks. It is our hope that this work will become the framework for further research in mobile commerce.

TI  - Dynamics and sustainable utilization of rangeland ecosystems in arid and semi-arid climates of southern Africa
DO  - 10.1006/JARE.1998.0387
PY  - 1998///
AB  - Abstract This review examines the conservation, risk, productivity, viability and acceptability of range management technology as it relates to sustaining rangeland ecosystems specifically in arid and semi-arid climates. The efficiency, cost effectiveness and risk with which rainfall is converted into plant production, and eventually gross farming income, without deterioration of natural resources form the essence of sustainability of rangeland ecosystems in these areas. Range and soil degradation can dramatically influence soil water balance, nutrient cycling, soil loss, production and the economics of a farm unit. Management for long-term sustainability often requires sacrifice of short-term welfare. With respect to deterioration and loss of productivity of natural vegetation, a co-ordinated approach is needed towards establishing a comprehensive inventory of the condition of national vegetation resources on a geographically and scientifically sound basis.

DO  - 10.1080/0020754031000138330
PY  - 2003///
AB  - Stock control in Supply Chain management is of concern here, particularly an industrial practice observed in the automotive manufacturing context and defined as 'Consignment Stock' (CS). To understand the potentiality of CS policy, an analytical modelling is offered that refers to the problem of a single-vendor and single-buyer productive situation. A comparison with the optimal solution available in the literature is also shown. The conclusion proposes a method that is useful in identifying those productive situations where CS might be implemented successfully. Results show how CS policy might be a strategic and profitable approach to stock management in uncertain environments, i.e. where delivery lead times or market demand vary over time.

AB  - PURPOSE A review of the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). NUMBER OF STUDIES: Seventy-four studies. MATERIALS/METHODS Articles published between January 1990 and May 2012 were identified by searches in PubMed electronic database. Of the 227 articles meeting the inclusion criteria 74 were reviewed. These articles are discussed under nine topics; Reliability, validity and internal consistency of the original version of DHI, relationship between vestibular/balance tests and DHI, association between DHI and the other scales related to balance impairments, exploratory factor analysis of the DHI, screening version of DHI, translations of DHI into other languages, the role of DHI to assess the success of the treatment of balance disorder, DHI results in various vestibular disorders, general characteristics of DHI in patients with balance impairment. CONCLUSIONS Self reported measures represent unique pieces of the information important for the management of dizzy patients. DHI is the most widely used self reported measurement of patients with dizziness. It has been translated into fourteen languages, so it is widely accepted.

Demand is Poisson, service times and lead times are exponentially distributed. These distributions are used to calculate performance measures of the respective systems. In case of infinite waiting room the key result is that the limiting distributions of the queue length processes are the same as in the classical M/M/1/∞-system.

TI  - An Empirical Examination of the Decision to Invest in Fulfillment Capabilities: A Study of Internet Retailers
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.1050.0493
PY  - 2006///
AB  - Internet technology has allowed for a higher degree of decoupling between the information-intensive sales process and the physical process of inventory management than its brick-and-mortar counterpart. As a result, some Internet retailers choose to outsource inventory and back-end operations to focus on the sales/marketing aspects of e-commerce. Nonetheless, many retailers keep fulfillment capabilities in-house. In this paper, we identify and empirically test factors that persuade firms to integrate inventory and fulfillment capabilities with virtual storefronts. Based on the extant literature and previous research in e-commerce, we formulate nine theoretical predictions. We then use data from a sample of over 50 public Internet retailers to test whether empirical data are consistent with these hypotheses. Finally, given the strategic importance and financial magnitude of the inventory investment decision, we analyze the effect of this decision on the economic success of Internet retailers during the period of study. We find that there are many circumstances in which it is prudent to own fulfillment capabilities and inventory. Empirical data are consistent with hypotheses that this tendency is higher for older firms selling small, high-margin products, offering lower levels of product variety, and facing lower demand uncertainty. We also discover that firms making inventory ownership decisions that are consistent with an empirical benchmark derived from environmental and strategic factors are less likely to go bankrupt than those making inconsistent inventory choices.

DO  - 10.1002/AIC.12338
PY  - 2011///
AB  - We address in this article the mid-term planning of chemical complexes with integration of stochastic inventory management under supply and demand uncertainty. By using the guaranteed service approach to model time delays in the flows inside the network, we capture the stochastic nature of the supply and demand variations, and develop an equivalent deterministic optimization model to minimize the production, feedstock purchase, cycle inventory, and safety stock costs. The model determines the optimal purchases of the feedstocks, production levels of the processes, sales of final products, and safety stock levels of all the chemicals. We formulate the model as a mixed-integer nonlinear program with a nonconvex objective function and nonconvex constraints. To solve the global optimization problem with modest computational times, we exploit some model properties and develop a tailored branch-and-refine algorithm based on successive piecewise linear approximation. Five industrial-scale examples with up to 38 processes and 28 chemicals are presented to illustrate the application of the model and the performance of the proposed algorithm. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2011

PY  - 2003///
AB  - Abstract Assessing the management effectiveness of a protected area system can enable policymakers to develop strategic, systemwide responses to pervasive management problems. The World Wide Fund for Nature International has developed the Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM) methodology. This article summarizes results from the implementation of the RAPPAM methodology in Bhutan, China, Russia, and South Africa. Five threats emerged warranting concerted policy effort: poaching, alien plants, tourism, logging, and encroachment. Similarly, five management issues emerged that influence protected area management effectiveness: funding, staffing, research and monitoring, resource inventories, and community relations. By identifying the most pressing issues in protected areas, an assessment of management effectiveness can be used to improve protected area management.

TI  - Using the Bidr to Distinguish the Effects of Impression Management and Self-Deception on the Criterion Validity of Personality Measures: A Meta-Analysis
DO  - 10.1111/j.1468-2389.2006.00339.x
PY  - 2006///
AB  - Although the use of personality tests for personnel selection has gained increasing acceptance, researchers have raised concerns that job applicants may distort their responses to inflate their scores. In the present meta-analysis, we examined the effects of the two dimensions of social desirability, impression management and self-deception, on the criterion validity of personality constructs using the balanced inventory of desirable responding (BIDR). The results indicate that impression management and self-deception did not create spurious effects on the relationship between personality measures and performance, nor did they function as performance predictors. Moreover, removing the influence of impression management or self-deception from personality measures did not substantially attenuate the criterion validity of personality variables. Implications of the results and directions for future research are also discussed.

AB  - The authors examine the source of the large fall and rebound in U.S. trade in the recent recession. While trade fell and rebounded more than expenditures or production of traded goods, they find that relative to the magnitude of the downturn, these trade fluctuations were in line with those in previous business cycle fluctuations. The authors argue that the high volatility of trade is attributed to more severe inventory management considerations of firms involved in international trade. They present empirical evidence for autos as well as at the aggregate level that the adjustment of inventory holdings helps explain these fluctuations in trade.

PY  - 2000///
AB  - Numerous investigations have indicated that projected climate change will impact strongly on forest growth and composition. To adapt managed forests to changing environmental conditions it may be necessary to modify traditional forest management strategies. An extended version of a forest gap model was applied to a managed forest district in northeastern Germany. The model was initialized with forest inventory data and run using routines devised to simulate three management scenarios: (1) maximized timber production, (2) climatically well-adapted forest composition, and (3) maximized tree species diversity. The strategies were compared with a baseline scenario of traditional management without any response to climate change. The comparisons were based on simulated wood production and species composition after 110 years of development. The results underline the important influence that management strategies have on forest growth. Forest management may adopt a variety of strategies to respond to the expected changes in climate. Process-oriented forest gap models can aid in the assessment of these strategies.

TI  - Closed-Form Solutions for Robust Inventory Management
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.2015.2391
PY  - 2017///
AB  - We propose and analyze robust optimization models of an inventory management problem, where cumulative purchase, inventory, and shortage costs over n periods are minimized for correlated nonidentically distributed demand. We assume that the means and covariance matrix of stochastic demand are known; the distributions are not needed. We derive closed-form ordering quantities for both symmetric and asymmetric uncertainty sets, under capacitated inventory constraints, in both static and dynamic settings. The behaviors of our robust strategies differ qualitatively depending on the symmetry of the uncertainty set. For instance, considering our simplest static problem, (1) if the uncertainty set is symmetric, then there is positive ordering in all periods, whereas (2) if the set is asymmetric, then there is a set of periods in the middle of the planning horizon with zero orders. We also link the symmetry of the uncertainty set to the symmetry of the demand distribution. Finally, we present encouraging computati...

TI  - Inventory Pooling Under Heavy-Tailed Demand
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.2015.2204
PY  - 2016///
AB  - Risk pooling has been studied extensively in the operations management literature as the basic driver behind strategies such as transshipment, manufacturing flexibility, component commonality, and drop shipping. This paper explores the benefit of risk pooling in the context of inventory management using the canonical model first studied in Eppen [Eppen GD (1979) Effects of centralization on expected costs in a multi-location newsboy problem. Management Sci. 25(5):498–501]. Specifically, we consider a single-period, multilocation newsvendor model, where n different locations face independent and identically distributed demands and linear holding and backorder costs. We show that Eppen’s celebrated result, i.e., that the expected cost savings from centralized inventory management scale with the square root of the number of locations, depends critically on the “light-tailed” nature of the demand uncertainty. In particular, we establish that the benefit from pooling relative to the decentralized case, in term...

DO  - 10.1579/0044-7447-32.5.374
PY  - 2003///
AB  - Abstract Along the Swedish Skagerrak coast eelgrass (Zostera marina) is a dominant phanerogam on shallow soft bottoms. Eelgrass meadows are important biotopes for many crustacean and fish species being either migratory or stationary. During the 1980s, inventories of the shallow coastal areas with eelgrass have been carried out along the Swedish west coast as a basis for coastal zone management. In the present study we revisited 2000 ha of eelgrass meadows in 5 coastal regions along 200 km of the Skagerrak coast. The inventory was made with the same methods (aquascope) as during the 1980s, but increasing the mapping accuracy by using a Global Positioning System (GPS). The results from this study show that the areal extension of Zostera marina has decreased 58% in 10–15 years with great regional variations. The decline was mainly restricted to the shallow parts of the meadow. The causes and ecological consequences are discussed.

TI  - Inventory Decisions in Dell's Supply Chain
DO  - 10.1287/inte.1030.0068
PY  - 2004///
AB  - The Tauber Manufacturing Institute (TMI) is a partnership between the engineering and business schools at the University of Michigan. In the summer of 1999, a TMI team spent 14 weeks at Dell Inc. in Austin, Texas, and developed an inventory model to identify inventory drivers and quantify target levels for inventory in the final stage of Dell's supply chain, the revolvers or supplier logistics centers (SLC). With the information and analysis provided by this model, Dell's regional materials organizations could tactically manage revolver inventory while Dell's worldwide commodity management could partner with suppliers in improvement projects to identify inventory drivers and to reduce inventory. Dell also initiated a pilot program for procurement of XDX (a disguised name for one of the major components of personal computers (PCs)) in the United States to institutionalize the model and promote partnership with suppliers. Based on the model predictions, Dell launched e-commerce and manufacturing initiatives with its suppliers to lower supply-chain-inventory costs by reducing revolver inventory by 40 percent. This reduction would raise the corresponding inventory turns by 67 percent. Net Present Value (NPV) calculations for XDX alone suggest $43 million in potential savings. To ensure project longevity, Dell formed the supply-chain-optimization team and charged it with incorporating the model into a strategic redesign of Dell's business practices and supervising improvement projects the model identified.

TI  - Risk Management of Domino Effects Considering Dynamic Consequence Analysis
DO  - 10.1111/risa.12158
PY  - 2014///
AB  - Domino effects are low‐probability high‐consequence accidents causing severe damage to humans, process plants, and the environment. Because domino effects affect large areas and are difficult to control, preventive safety measures have been given priority over mitigative measures. As a result, safety distances and safety inventories have been used as preventive safety measures to reduce the escalation probability of domino effects. However, these safety measures are usually designed considering static accident scenarios. In this study, we show that compared to a static worst‐case accident analysis, a dynamic consequence analysis provides a more rational approach for risk assessment and management of domino effects. This study also presents the application of Bayesian networks and conflict analysis to risk‐based allocation of chemical inventories to minimize the consequences and thus to reduce the escalation probability. It emphasizes the risk management of chemical inventories as an inherent safety measure, particularly in existing process plants where the applicability of other safety measures such as safety distances is limited.

PY  - 2008///
AB  - In this article, we consider a classic dynamic inventory control problem of a self‐financing retailer who periodically replenishes its stock from a supplier and sells it to the market. The replenishment decisions of the retailer are constrained by cash flow, which is updated periodically following purchasing and sales in each period. Excess demand in each period is lost when insufficient inventory is in stock. The retailer's objective is to maximize its expected terminal wealth at the end of the planning horizon. We characterize the optimal inventory control policy and present a simple algorithm for computing the optimal policies for each period. Conditions are identified under which the optimal control policies are identical across periods. We also present comparative statics results on the optimal control policy. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval Research Logistics 2008

TI  - Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Model for Refinery Short-Term Scheduling of Crude Oil Unloading with Inventory Management
DO  - 10.1021/IE950519H
PY  - 1996///
AB  - This paper addresses the problem of inventory management of a refinery that imports several types of crude oil which are delivered by different vessels. This problem involves optimal operation of crude oil unloading, its transfer from storage tanks to charging tanks, and the charging schedule for each crude oil distillation unit. A mixed-integer optimization model is developed which relies on time discretization. The problem involves bilinear equations due to mixing operations. However, the linearity in the form of a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is maintained by replacing bilinear terms with individual component flows. The LP-based branch and bound method is applied to solve the model, and several techniques, such as priority branching and bounding, and special ordered sets are implemented to reduce the computation time. This formulation and solution method was applied to an industrial-size problem involving 3 vessels, 6 storage tanks, 4 charging tanks, and 3 crude oil distillation units over 15 time intervals. The MILP model contained 105 binary variables, 991 continuous variables, and 2154 constraints and was effectively solved with the proposed solution approach.

AB  - Theory and research are suggesting that personality hardiness is a composite of interrelated attitudes of commitment, control, and challenge that facilitates the management of stressful circumstances by turning them into growth-inducing rather than debilitating experiences. The two studies reported here seek to further our understanding of the overall importance of hardiness in living. The first study determines the correlational pattern between hardiness and the various scales of the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory III and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2. The second study concerns the correlational pattern between hardiness and the five-factor model, as measured by the NEO Five Factor Inventory. The results of both studies suggest that both total hardiness and its components of commitment, control, and challenge express vigorous mental health.

TI  - Technical Note - Optimal Product Acquisition, Pricing, and Inventory Management for Systems with Remanufacturing
DO  - 10.1287/opre.1100.0898
PY  - 2011///
AB  - Acquisition of used products (cores) is central to the success of remanufacturing programs for companies. At the same time, dynamic pricing strategies have been adopted in various industries to better balance supply and customer demand. In this paper, we study the integration of these two aspects of operations together with inventory management for a production/remanufacturing firm. We develop a periodic-review single-product inventory system with price-dependent customer demand. The product return in each period is random but can be actively controlled by the firm's acquisition effort. The firm aims to maximize its total discounted profit over a finite planning horizon by implementing optimal production, remanufacturing, product acquisition, and pricing strategies. We first show that with an exogenous selling price, the optimal production-remanufacturing-disposal policy is simple and characterized by three state-independent parameters. The optimal acquisition effort is decreasing in the aggregate inventory level of serviceable product and cores. Nevertheless, when pricing is an endogenous decision, we find that the optimal policy becomes much more complicated, and its control parameters are state dependent. The optimal selling price is decreasing, whereas the optimal acquisition effort is increasing in the serviceable product inventory level, and both decisions decrease with the aggregate inventory level.

TI  - The inventory routing problem: the value of integration
DO  - 10.1111/itor.12226
PY  - 2016///
AB  - We consider an inventory routing problem in which a supplier delivers goods to customers over a given planning period. Before the advent of the supply chain management concept, customers usually applied a policy for the inventory management. The supplier then, on the basis of the distribution schedule determined by the customers, organized the distribution routes. In an integrated approach, the supplier has access to the inventory levels at the customers and knowledge of their demand process. On the basis of this information the supplier organizes a complete distribution plan, determining the days of visit, quantities to deliver, and distribution routes. This integrated policy is called vendor-managed inventory policy. We solve the optimization problems arising in the traditional and integrated management, and analyze the two approaches, comparing the costs and characteristics of the different solutions.

DO  - 10.1080/00207540310001632448
PY  - 2004///
AB  - Nowadays supply chain management is a popular practice in manufacturing systems, and just-in-time (JIT) production plays a crucial role in supply chain environments. Companies are using JIT production to gain and maintain a competitive advantage. The characteristics of JIT systems are consistent high quality, small lot sizes, frequent delivery, short lead time, and close supplier ties. This paper presents an integrated inventory model to minimize the sum of the ordering/setup cost, holding cost, quality improvement investment and crashing cost by simultaneously optimizing the order quantity, lead time, process quality and number of deliveries while the probability distribution of the lead time demand is normal. This integrated inventory model is useful particularly for JIT inventory systems where the vendor and the purchaser form a strategic alliance for profit sharing.

TI  - Demand Management and Inventory Control for Substitutable Products
DO  - 10.2139/ssrn.3866775
PY  - 2007///
AB  - This paper studies dynamic inventory and pricing decisions for a set of substitutable products over a flnite planning horizon. We present a general stochastic, price-dependent demand model that unifles many commonly used demand models in the literature. Unsatisfled demands are backlogged. There are linear purchasing, inventory-holding, and backordering costs. The objective is to maximize the total expected discounted proflt. The original formulation is not jointly concave in the decision variables and is therefore intractable. One key observation here is that the problem becomes jointly concave if we work with the inverse of the price vector { the market share vector. We characterize the optimal policy and develop algorithms to compute it. We establish conditions under which the optimal policy demonstrates certain monotonicity property, which, in turn, can greatly enhance computation. We also analyze the myopic policy and its optimality, and present a numerical study to illustrate the interplay of the pricing and inventory decisions.

TI  - Options for sampling and stratification for national forest inventories to implement REDD+ under the UNFCCC
DO  - 10.1186/1750-0680-5-9
PY  - 2010///
AB  - BackgroundDeveloping countries that are willing to participate in the recently adopted (16th Session of the Conference of Parties (COP) in Cancun) mitigation mechanism of Reducing emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation - and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+) - will have to establish a national forest monitoring system in order to assess anthropogenic forest-related greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks. Such a system should support the Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) requirement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as the REDD+ mechanism is results-based. A national forest inventory (NFI) is one potential key component of such an MRV system. Following the Decision adopted during the 15th Session of the COP in Copenhagen, the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidance and Guidelines should be used as a basis for estimating anthropogenic forest-related greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks and changes in forest carbon stocks and area.ResultsFirst, we present the key indispensable elements of the IPCC Guidance and Guidelines that have been developed to fulfil the UNFCCC reporting requirements. This is done in order to set the framework to develop the MRV requirement in which a NFI for REDD+ implementation could be developed. Second, within this framework, we develop and propose a novel scheme for the stratification of forest land for REDD+. Finally, we present some non-exhaustive optional elements within this framework that a country could consider to successfully operationalise and implement its REDD+ NFI.ConclusionEvidently, both the methodological guidance and political decisions on REDD+ under the UNFCCC will continue to evolve. Even so, and considering that there exists decades of experience in setting up traditional NFIs, developing a NFI that a country may use to directly support REDD+ activities under the UNFCCC represents the development of a new challenge in this field. It is therefore important that both the scientific community and national implementing agencies acquaint themselves with both the context and content of this challenge so that REDD+ mitigation actions may be implemented successfully and with environmental integrity. This paper provides important contributions to the subject through our proposal of the stratification of forest land for REDD+.

TI  - Issues in reverse supply chains, part I: end‐of‐life product recovery and inventory management – an overview
DO  - 10.1080/19397030802433860
PY  - 2008///
AB  - Recovery of used products has become a field of rapidly growing importance in reverse supply chain management. Product recovery includes collection, inspection/separation, disassembly, reconditioning/reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling. In real time situations, the collection of end‐of‐life (EoL) products from the customer and their return to the manufacturer is tedious and time consuming. Reduced product life cycles have increased the rate of product returns and disposals. Owing to shortened product economic life cycles, the recovery of value from EoL products is becoming a necessity. Companies have realised the value that they could recover by remanufacturing or recycling EoL products. Researchers have developed various models for product recovery network design, optimal inventory, production planning and control, remanufacturing, recycling, disposal, etc. The main purpose of this paper is to review the literature on EoL product recovery and inventory management issues in reverse supply chains and to outline some future directions for research on these issues.

TI  - The Finnish National Forest Inventory
DO  - 10.1007/1-4020-4381-3_11
PY  - 1995///
AB  - The National Forest Inventory (NFI) of Finland has produced large-area forest resource infor- mation since the beginning of 1920s (Ilvessalo 1927). When the 10 th inventory (NFI10) started in 2004, the design was changed and the rotation shortened to 5 years. Measurements are done in the entire country each year through measuring one-fifth of the plots. About one-fifth of all plots are measured as perma- nent. Using field data only, it is possible to compute reliable estimates for large areas, the minimum size of the area is typically some hundreds of thousands of hectares. In practical forestry, estimates are also often required for smaller units such as municipalities with typical areas of tens of thousands of hectares. This is possible only if ancillary data are used in addition to sparse field data. The Finnish multisource NFI uses satellite images and digital map data, in addition to field data, and produces estimates for small areas and wall-to-wall maps. Information from the Finnish NFI has traditionally been used in large area forest management planning, such as planning regional and national level cutting, improving silviculture and forest regimes, making decisions concerning forest industry investments, and providing a basis for forest income taxation. The NFI also provides forest resource information for national and international forest statistics and processes such as the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Forest Resource Assessment process and the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry reporting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.. Sampling designs for the ninth inventory rotation (NFI9)—conducted from 1996 to 2003—and NFI10 are described, as well as the basic principles of estimation methods based on field data only.

PY  - 2020///
AB  - The concept of minimum display quantity (MDQ) is unavoidable in brick-and-mortar retailing format owing to which, retailers need to ensure a minimum level of inventory displayed at each store irrespective of the revenue or inventory turns generated by a particular store. It is observed that majority of bricks-and-mortar retailers in India assume;(a) existing inventory management system is ideal to their store, (b) software solutions record accurate inventory movement, (c) involving store management team in inventory related decision making is risky/biased and most importantly (d) loss of sale due to stockouts is inevitable. Such assumptions and widely followed practice have created a predisposition and mindset in store managers and they believe that their store delivers revenue and profit to the best of its potential with the inventory which is made available to them through existing inventory management system and we cannot avoid a number of instances consumers are unsatisfied due to stockout situations. In this research, we have analysed the existing decision-making process and control systems related to inventory management of a select retailer, attempted to design a new framework and applied the same through an experiment to evaluate the change in (a) overall store profitability and (b) inventory related key performance indicators.

TI  - Pipeline Scheduling and Inventory Management of a Multiproduct Distribution Oil System
DO  - 10.1021/IE060309C
PY  - 2006///
AB  - Within the oil supply chain, although refinery operations are extensively studied, distribution center operations are not being explored to their full potential. In this paper, these types of operations are studied. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach is used to model the problem of oil derivatives pipeline transportation scheduling and supply management. The objective of the model is to attain a high level of operation, satisfying clients and accounting for distribution center restrictions and compulsory tasks. First, a base model is developed, which accounts for product transportation, inventory management, and daily client satisfaction. Later, an extension is presented to account for a settling period for each new lot that arrives at the distribution center. A pumping schedule, including the product sequence, lot volume, and timing issues, is obtained. Also, the inventory management is performed while accounting for daily clients requests and quality control tasks. A continuous represent...

TI  - An RFID-based digital warehouse management system in the tobacco industry: a case study
DO  - 10.1080/00207540903564918
PY  - 2010///
AB  - This paper proposes a digital warehouse management system (DWMS) in the tobacco industry based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. The DWMS helps warehouse managers to achieve better inventory control, as well as to improve the operation efficiency. In this system, a set of basic events and storage/retrieval rules are defined as event-condition-action (ECA) rules to improve the feasibility and flexibility of DWMS. By using RFID technology, the DWMS enables a plane warehouse to achieve visualised inventory management, automatic storage/retrieval assignment and high accuracy of inventory control as an automatic warehouse. A case in the tobacco industry is studied to illustrate the feasibility and rationality of the proposed system. Based on the ECA rules, a storage/retrieval methodology is proposed to improve the storage/retrieval operations. The results of this case study illustrate that RFID-DWMS can help a plane warehouse to improve operation efficiency, enhance the utilisation of warehouse capacity, increase inventory accuracy and reduce manpower and loading time significantly.

TI  - Optimal Policies of Yield Management with Multiple Predetermined Prices
DO  - 10.1287/opre.48.2.332.13373
PY  - 2000///
AB  - It is a common practice for industries to price the same products at different levels. For example, airlines charge various fares for a common pool of seats. Seasonal products are sold at full or discount prices during different phases of the season. This article presents a model that reflects this yield management problem. The model assumes that (1) products are offered at multiple predetermined prices over time; (2) demand is price sensitive and obeys the Poisson process; and (3) price is allowed to change monotonically, i.e., either the markup or markdown policy is implemented. To maximize the expected revenue, management needs to determine the optimal times to switch between prices based on the remaining season and inventory. Major results in this research include (1) an exact solution for the continuous-time model; (2) piecewise concavity of the value function with respect to time and inventory; and (3) monotonicity of the optimal policy. The implementation of optimal policies is fairly facile because of the existence of threshold points embedded in the value function. The value function and time thresholds can be solved with a reasonable computation effort. Numerical examples are provided.

TI  - Municipal solid waste management in Thailand and disposal emission inventory
DO  - 10.1007/S10661-007-9707-1
PY  - 2007///
AB  - The increasing municipal solid waste (MSW) generation along with the high fraction of organic waste and a common disposal of open dumping is the current scenario in many areas in Thailand. As a response to this problem, the country’s Pollution Control Department (PCD) aims to reduce the MSW generation rate to less than 1 kg/capita/day, increase the collection efficiency, and improve the recovery of recyclables. For many years, more than 60% of the solid waste disposal system in Thailand has been carried out by open dumping. According to the survey conducted by this study, in 2004 there were 425 disposal sites (95 landfills; 330 open dumps) in Thailand and an estimated methane emission of 115.4 Gg/year was generated based on this practice. It has been estimated that the anticipated methane emission in Thailand will rise from 115.4 Gg/year to 118.5 Gg/year if the largest open dumpsites in provinces with no existing landfill are upgraded to sanitary landfill; and it will increase to 193.5 Gg/year if the existing sanitary landfill is upgraded to integrated waste management facilities. Moreover, Bangkok metropolitan have the highest methane emission (54.83 Gg/year) among all the regions in Thailand. The methane emission forecast of 339 Gg/year by 2020 (based on LandGEM methodology) provides a stimulus to create a comprehensive plan to capture and utilize methane as an energy source.

TI  - Genetic algorithm optimisation of an integrated aggregate production–distribution plan in supply chains
DO  - 10.1080/00207543.2011.571447
PY  - 2012///
AB  - A production plan concerns the allocation of resources of the company to meet the demand forecast over a certain planning horizon and a distribution plan involves the management of warehouse storage assignments, transport routings and inventory management issues. A production–distribution plan integrates the decisions in production, transport and warehousing as well as inventory management. The overall performance of a supply-chain is influenced significantly by the decisions taken in its production–distribution plan and hence one key issue in the performance evaluation of a supply chain is the modelling and optimisation of the production–distribution plan considering its actual complexity. Based on the integration of Aggregate Production Plan and Distribution Plan, this article develops a mixed integer non-linear formulation for a two-echelon supply network (i.e. a production-distribution network) considering the real-world variables and constraints. Genetic Algorithm (GA), known as a robust technique for solving complex problems, is employed for the optimisation of the developed mathematical model due to its ability to effectively deal with a large number of parameters. To demonstrate the applicability of the methodology, a real-life case study will be finally studied incorporating the production of different types of products in several manufacturing plants and the distribution of finished products from plants to a number of end-users via multiple direct/indirect transport routes.

TI  - Health‐related quality of life and seizure control in temporal lobe epilepsy
DO  - 10.1002/ANA.410410411
PY  - 1997///
AB  - We conducted a prospective study over 24 months to compare health‐related quality of life in surgically and medically treated patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. Seizure frequency and health‐related quality of life were assessed in 81 patients before and 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment. Using the Epilepsy Surgery Inventory 55 (ESI‐55), we compared (1) different seizure outcome groups and (2) temporal lobectomy with continuing medical management. Follow‐up was satisfactory in 72 patients (89%), 51 treated with temporal lobectomy and 21 with no surgery. Pretreatment seizures and health‐related quality of life were comparable in the two groups. Seizure outcome was significantly better at 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. At 24 months, seizure‐free patients and those with at least a 90% reduction in seizure frequency reported significant improvements in health‐related quality of life (on 5 of 10 subscales and overall Epilepsy Surgery Inventory 55 scale). Deterioration in quality of life occurred with less than 90% seizure reduction. Only one Epilepsy Surgery Inventory 55 subscale at 6 months and two subscales at 12 months showed a significant difference. Patients with good seizure outcome experience improved health‐related quality of life after treatment. Since temporal lobectomy results in considerably better seizure control than continued medical management, the findings support surgery as the preferred treatment, although changes in health‐related quality of life may not be evident until the second postoperative year.

DO  - 10.1023/B:JOBM.0000019849.21524.70
PY  - 2004///
AB  - This study analyzes the relationships between neuroticism, extroversion, age, and sex and the intensity of perceived pain and the coping strategies used. We worked with a sample of 96 patients with chronic pain. The assessment tools were the following: the Vanderbilt Pain Management Inventory, a Spanish version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, and the Eysenck Personality Inventory. The hypothetical model establishes positive relationships between neuroticism, the use of passive coping strategies, and the intensity of pain. On the other hand, extraversion is expected to be positively related to the use of active coping strategies and negatively related to the perceived intensity of pain. The results support the hypotheses formulated regarding the effects of the variables neuroticism and extraversion. Age is negatively related to active coping strategies and pain intensity. Men use more active strategies than women, while the latter have a greater perception of pain.

TI  - Evaluation of hospital medication inventory policies
DO  - 10.1007/s10729-013-9251-1
PY  - 2014///
AB  - As supply chain costs constitute a large portion of hospitals’ operating expenses and with $27.7 billion spent by the US hospitals on drugs alone in 2009, improving medication inventory management provides a great opportunity to decrease the cost of healthcare. This study investigates different management approaches for a system consisting of one central storage location, the main pharmacy, and multiple dispensing machines located in each department. Each medication has a specific unit cost, availability from suppliers, criticality level, and expiration date. Event-driven simulation is used to evaluate the performance of several inventory policies based on the total cost and patient safety (service level) under various arrangements of the system defined by the number of drugs and departments, and drugs’ criticality, availability, and expiration levels. Our results show that policies that incorporate drug characteristics in ordering decisions can address the tradeoff between patient safety and cost. Indeed, this study shows that such policies can result in higher patient safety and lower overall cost when compared to traditional approaches. Additional insights from this study allow for better understanding of the medication inventory system’s dynamics and suggest several directions for future research in this topic. Findings of this study can be applied to help hospital pharmacies with managing their inventory.

AB  - Revenue management is a sophisticated form of supply and demand management that helps a firm maximise revenue by balancing pricing and inventory controls. In recent years, an increasing number of firms have recognised the importance of revenue management in their ability to increase sales and profitability. When a firm that is fundamentally customer oriented also embraces revenue management, however, a series of customer conflicts can result and be detrimental to the firm's long-term success. This paper outlines these potential conflicts and explores various marketing and organisational strategies that can be used to resolve such conflicts.

DO  - 10.1080/00207540050176003
PY  - 2000///
AB  - Remanufacturing requires that used products (cores) be obtained from the enduser at the end of their current life cycle so that the value-added may be recovered and the products returned to functional use again. The acquisition of cores to be remanufactured in such recoverable manufacturing systems is a complex set of activities that requires careful coordination to avoid the uncontrolled accumulation of core inventory, or unacceptable levels of customer service. The authors report on current industry practice via an extensive survey of North American remanufacturing firms. The authors propose a formal framework for Product Acquisition Management (PrAM) to coordinate, monitor, and provide an interface between reverse logistics and production planning and control activities. Finally, a series of managerial guidelines for the organization of PrAM activities is proposed. We conclude that managers should take actions that consistently reduce the variance inherent in a remanufacturing environment.

AB  - Accurately assessing leadership behavior continues to be important to both researchers and management development practitioners. In a series of follow-up studies employing the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI), data from over 36,000 respondents were used to reexamine the psychometric properties of the instrument and to explore possible gender, functional field, ethnic and/or cross-cultural background differences. Factor analytic results sup- ported a 5-factor scale that was consistent with the five hypothesized dimensions of the LPI (Challenging, Inspiring, Enabling, Modeling, and Encouraging). Gender differences were observed for performance on the Modeling and Encouraging subscales with females reportedly engaging in these activities more frequently than do males. Additional findings are discussed.

TI  - Geosites Inventory in the Leon Province (Northwestern Spain): A Tool to Introduce Geoheritage into Regional Environmental Management
DO  - 10.1007/S12371-010-0012-Y
PY  - 2010///
AB  - This paper deals with the main results and methodological processing of the first inventory of Geosites of the province of Leon (Autonomous Region of Castile and Leon, Spain). The inventory was designed to be used as a tool for introducing geoheritage in regional and local environmental management. This main aim determined the methodology of selection, study, description, and evaluation of every site. One of the main contributions in this work is the proposal of classifying Geosites in five typological categories: point, section, area, complex area, and viewpoint. This grouping allows one to summarize the basic features and the best way to popularize each geosite. We also detail both the problematic of dealing with diverse types of Geosites and the management advices proposed to solve it.

PY  - 2004///
AB  - Organizations realize that a strong supporting logistics or electronic logistics (e‐logistics) function is an important organizational offering from both the commercial and the consumer perspective. The implications of e‐logistics models and practices cover the forward and reverse logistics functions of organizations. They also have a direct and profound impact from an environmental perspective. Focuses on a discussion of forward and reverse e‐logistics and their relationship to the natural environment. The issues analyzed include those of traditional green logistics and supply chain management functions such as: inventory management, transportation, warehousing, delivery management, supplier management, packaging and order management. Issues relevant to each of these major areas from the electronic commerce and natural environment overlap are discussed. Examples of practices and results are integrated. Environmental issues facing reverse e‐logistics are also described. Brings to the forefront the reverse e‐logistics function, which has been selcom studied even from a non‐environmental perspective. After discussion of the many pertinent issues in these areas, direction of practice and implications for study and research are then presented.

DO  - 10.1109/CDC.1997.652501
PY  - 1997///
AB  - We discuss an application of neuro-dynamic programming techniques to the optimization of retailer inventory systems. We describe a specific case study involving a model with thirty-three state variables. The enormity of this state space renders classical algorithms of dynamic programming inapplicable. We compare the performance of solutions generated by neuro-dynamic programming algorithms to that delivered by optimized s-type ("order-up-to") policies. We are able to generate control strategies substantially superior, reducing inventory costs by approximately ten percent.

DO  - 10.2466/pms.1994.78.2.539
PY  - 1994///
AB  - This investigation examined the factor structure and correlates of the Reasons for Exercise Inventory among 101 exercising women. Subjects completed the 24-item inventory (with one added item), reported their weekly frequency of exercise, and completed two standardized body-image measures. Factor analysis indicated that, with minor modifications, the instrument has an internally consistent structure with four factors of Appearance/Weight Management, Fitness/Health Management, Stress/ Mood Management, and Socializing. Appearance/Weight Management was associated with a more negative body image independent of actual body mass and was the only motive related to self-reported frequency of exercise.

PY  - 2007///
AB  - Purpose – The aim of this paper is to explore the role of inventory and warehousing within international supply chains and, from this, to develop an exploratory framework that assists understanding in the area.Design/methodology/approach – The research is based on case studies of 13 supply chains in six companies, using pipeline mapping techniques, questionnaires, quantitative measures of lead times, and Likert scales to measure the perceptions of supply chain managers to risk.Findings – The results indicate that, for these case study supply chains, the supplier lead times were far in excess of the customer lead times and that, with the exception of new product lines, demand therefore needed to be supplied from inventory. In addition, inventory was a common risk mitigation strategy against the possibility of random demand variability and transportation delays. Based on these findings, an exploratory framework was developed to integrate such factors as inventory reduction strategies, risk management and in...

TI  - Relationship between Inventory Management and Profitability: An Empirical Analysis of Indian Cement Companies
PY  - 2013///
AB  - The importance of efficient working capital management (WCM) is indisputable. Moreover, the adequate and timely flow of inventory is imperative for the success and growth of any company. The present paper is an attempt to study in depth the inventory management practices of Indian cement companies and its impact on working capital efficiency. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between inventory conversion period and firms‟ profitability. The dependent variable, gross operating profit is used as a measure of profitability and the relation between inventory management and profitability is investigated for a sample of five top Indian cement companies over a period of ten years from 2001-2010. This study employs Regression analysis to determine the impact of inventory conversion period over gross operating profit taking current ratio, size of the firm, financial debt ratio as control variables. The results indicate that there is a significant negative linear relationship between inventory conversion period and profitability. The results of this research are in line with the previous findings. The findings indicate that Inventory conversion period has an inverse relationship with firms profitability i.e. when the ICP days increase the profitability of firm decreases and vice versa. It was found that, the firms profitability as measured by GOP has a negative relationship with financial debt ratio. This implied that profitability increases with decrease in financial debt ratio. Furthermore in this study the relationship between the firm size and GOP was positive which indicates that profitability increases with an increase in firm size. The relationship between current ratio and the GOP was negative.

AB  - The basic financial purpose of a firm is to maximize its value. An inventory management system should also contribute to realization of this basic aim. Many current asset management models currently found in financial management literature were constructed with the assumption of book profit maximization as basic aim. However these models could lack what relates to another aim, i.e., maximization of enterprise value. This article presents a modified value-based inventory management model.

DO  - 10.1080/00207548708919825
PY  - 1987///
AB  - Group technology is a management philosophy capable of jointly simplifying management control and improving productivity. This paper proposes a heuristic approach to the economic determination of machine groups and their corresponding component families for group technology. The procedure considers costs of work-in-process and cycle inventory, intra-group material handling, set-up, variable processing and fixed machine costs. The three stage procedure initially reorders part types based on routing similarity. An attempt is then made to combine adjacent part types to reduce machine requirements. Finally groups are combined where economic benefits of utilization offset those of set-up, work-in-process and material handling. Examples illustrating the procedure and potential savings are included.

TI  - Analyzing Impact of Intermodal Facilities on Design and Management of Biofuel Supply Chain
DO  - 10.3141/2191-18
PY  - 2010///
AB  - The impact of an intermodal facility on location and transportation decisions for biofuel production plants is analyzed. Location decisions affect the management of the inbound and outbound logistics of a plant. This supply chain design and management problem is modeled as a mixed integer program. Input data for this model are location of intermodal facilities and available transportation modes, cost and cargo capacity for each transportation mode, geographical distribution of biomass feedstock and production yields, and biomass processing and inventory costs. Outputs from this model are the number, location, and capacity of biofuel production plants. For each plant, the transportation mode used, timing of shipments, shipment size, inventory size, and production schedule that minimize the delivery cost of biofuel are determined. The model proposed in this research can be used as a decision-making tool for investors in the biofuels industry since it estimates the real cost of the business. The state of Mississippi is considered as the testing grounds for the model.

TI  - Development of a United States–Mexico Emissions Inventory for the Big Bend Regional Aerosol and Visibility Observational (BRAVO) Study
DO  - 10.1080/10473289.2005.10464648
PY  - 2005///
AB  - Abstract The Big Bend Regional Aerosol and Visibility Observational (BRAVO) Study was commissioned to investigate the sources of haze at Big Bend National Park in southwest Texas. The modeling domain of the BRAVO Study includes most of the continental United States and Mexico. The BRAVO emissions inventory was constructed from the 1999 National Emission Inventory for the United States, modified to include finer-resolution data for Texas and 13 U.S. states in close proximity. The first regional-scale Mexican emissions inventory designed for air-quality modeling applications was developed for 10 northern Mexican states, the Tula Industrial Park in the state of Hidalgo, and the Popocatépetl volcano in the state of Puebla. Emissions data were compiled from numerous sources, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (now Texas Commission on Environmental Quality), the Eastern Research Group, the Minerals Management Service, the Instituto Nacional de Ecología, and the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica Geografía y Informática. The inventory includes emissions for CO, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), ammonia, particulate matter (PM) <10 μm in aerodynamic diameter, and PM <2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter. Wind-blown dust and biomass burning were not included in the inventory, although high concentrations of dust and organic PM attributed to biomass burning have been observed at Big Bend National Park. The SMOKE modeling system was used to generate gridded emissions fields for use with the Regional Modeling System for Aerosols and Deposition (REMSAD) and the Community Multiscale Air Quality model modified with the Model of Aerosol Dynamics, Reaction, Ionization and Dissolution (CMAQ-MADRID). The compilation of the inventory, supporting model input data, and issues encountered during the development of the inventory are documented. A comparison of the BRAVO emissions inventory for Mexico with other emerging Mexican emission inventories illustrates their uncertainty.

TI  - Inventory management in a lateral collaborative manufacturing supply chain: a simulation study
DO  - 10.1080/00207543.2011.628709
PY  - 2012///
AB  - Due to global competition, firms are seeking more effective supply chain (SC) collaboration in order to provide quality products with less cost, at the right time and in the right quantity. The present study examines manufacturing SC collaboration on the basis of holding cost, backorder cost and ordering cost. The types of collaboration examined are vertical, horizontal and lateral collaboration. This research emphasises lateral collaboration by determining the impact of inventory policies ((s, S) and (s, Q) inventory policies) on SC performance. For better understanding, a conceptual model is provided that is supported by a numerical example. As the study of SCs is complex in nature, a simulation approach has been employed to show the impact of lateral collaboration on performance measures such as the total cost, which is the sum of several cost components: inventory holding cost, backorder cost and ordering cost. The research is based on two manufacturing SCs where the manufacturer is taken as the collaborative node. To allow more clarity, a separate study on each cost component has been conducted. The laterally collaborative SC was simulated on ARENA 9.0, a simulation package. The results show that the efficacy of lateral collaboration outperforms horizontal collaboration due to having the individual SC members at more liberty to make decisions.

DO  - 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6750(199609)43:6<839::AID-NAV4>3.0.CO;2-5
PY  - 1996///
AB  - The importance of effective inventory management has greatly increased for many major retailers because of more intense competition. Retail inventory management methods often use assumptions and demand distributions that were developed for application areas other than retailing. For example, it is often assumed that unmet demand is backordered and that demand is Poisson or normally distributed. In retailing, unmet demand is often lost and unobserved. Using sales data from a major retailing chain, our analysis found that the negative binomial fit significantly better than the Poisson or the normal distribution. A parameter estimation methodology that compensates for unobserved lost sales is developed for the negative binomial distribution. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated by comparing parameter estimates from the complete data set to estimates obtained by artificially truncating the data to simulate lost sales. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - The 2007–2009 recession led to a significant decrease in consumer demand. We use monthly inventory and sales data to study the impact of the recession on manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers in the U.S. manufacturing sector. We find wholesalers responded late and drastically, indicative of a bullwhip effect, while retailers responded quickly and more conservatively, indicative of environmental smoothing. Smoothing of demand and inventory is demonstrated as an alternative response to a significant change in demand.

TI  - Using scenario trees and progressive hedging for stochastic inventory routing problems
DO  - 10.1007/s10732-008-9076-0
PY  - 2009///
AB  - The Stochastic Inventory Routing Problem is a challenging problem, combining inventory management and vehicle routing, as well as including stochastic customer demands. The problem can be described by a discounted, infinite horizon Markov Decision Problem, but it has been showed that this can be effectively approximated by solving a finite scenario tree based problem at each epoch. In this paper the use of the Progressive Hedging Algorithm for solving these scenario tree based problems is examined. The Progressive Hedging Algorithm can be suitable for large-scale problems, by giving an effective decomposition, but is not trivially implemented for non-convex problems. Attempting to improve the solution process, the standard algorithm is extended with locking mechanisms, dynamic multiple penalty parameters, and heuristic intermediate solutions. Extensive computational results are reported, giving further insights into the use of scenario trees as approximations of Markov Decision Problem formulations of the Stochastic Inventory Routing Problem.

TI  - The Impact of Inventory Management Practices on Financial Performance of Sugar Manufacturing Firms in Kenya
PY  - 2013///
AB  - Manufacturing firms apply various techniques in the management of their inventories. The practices adopted have a significant impact on returns, profitability and volume of sales. Manufacturing firms that efficiently apply these practices have an excellent financial performance. This paper examines the impact of inventory management practices on the financial performance of sugar manufacturing firms in Kenya, by analyzing the extent to which lean inventory system, strategic supplier partnership and technology are being applied in these firms. The research survey was conducted in all the eight operating sugar manufacturing firms from the period 2002- 2007. The primary data was collected using structured and semi- structured questionnaires administered to key informants in the organizations. Secondary data was obtained from annual financial performance statements available in the year Book sugar statistics. Descriptive statistics was used to test the impact of inventory management practices and Correlation analysis was used to determine the nature and magnitude of the relationship among inventory management variables. The results indicate that there exists a positive correlation between inventory management and Return on Sales (r=0.740) and also with Return on Equity (r=0.653) which were found to be statistically significant at 5% level.

TI  - Improving Environmental Performance Assessment: A Comparative Analysis of Weighting Methods Used to Evaluate Chemical Release Inventories
DO  - 10.1162/1088198041269445
PY  - 2004///
AB  - Managers, management scholars, regulators, nonprofit organizations, and the media are increasingly using emissions inventory data to measure organizations' environmental performance. Whereas some analysts use total mass emitted, others have applied one or more of the growing number of toxicity‐weighting databases aimed at predicting the environmental and health impacts of emissions. Little research is available to guide analysts in selecting among these databases. This article compares 13 methods in terms of their sophistication, complexity, and comprehensiveness. Seven of these methods are then evaluated as to their usefulness in weighting emissions data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA's) toxic release inventory, and three pair‐wise comparisons are conducted. We recommend the U.S. EPA's Risk Screening Environmental Indicators for estimating impacts to human health. We recommend the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical Impacts for estimating impacts to human health and the environment.

TI  - Working Capital Management and Corporate Profitability of Japanese Firms
DO  - 10.2139/SSRN.1433243
PY  - 2009///
AB  - Abstract: This study examines the relationship between working capital management, profitability, firm size and industry type for firms in Japan. The study sample consists of 2123 Japanese non-financial firms listed at the Tokyo Stock Exchange for the period 1990-2004. We observe that the cash conversion cycle and return on investment relationships are commonly significant and negative, suggesting that the shortening of the cash conversion cycle enhances the profitability of Japanese firms. We also observe that all types of Japanese firms included in this study can increase their profitability by shortening the receivable collection period and shortening the inventory conversion periods. However, the slowing of payment to suppliers improves the profitability for service firms only. Keywords: Working Capital Management; Cash Conversion Cycle; Receivable Collection Period; Inventory Conversion Period; Payable Deferral Period; Return on Investment

AB  - We explore the management of inventory for stochastic-demand systems, where the product's supply is randomly disrupted for periods of random duration, and demands that arrive when the inventory system is temporarily out of stock become a mix of backorders and lost sales. The stock is managed according to the following modified (s, S) policy: If the inventory level is at or below s and the supply is available, place an order to bring the inventory level up to S. Our analysis yields the optimal values of the policy parameters, and provides insight into the optimal inventory strategy when there are changes in the severity of supply disruptions or in the behavior of unfilled demands. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

TI  - Can efficient supply management in the operating room save millions?
DO  - 10.1097/ACO.0b013e32832798ef
PY  - 2009///
AB  - Purpose of review Supply expenses occupy an ever-increasing portion of the expense budget in today's increasingly technologically complex operating rooms. Yet, little has been studied and published in the anesthesia literature. This review attempts to bring the topic of supply management to anesthesiologists, who play a significant role in operating room management. Recent findings Little investigative work has been performed on supply management. Anecdotal reports suggest the benefits of a perpetual inventory system over a periodic inventory system. A perpetual inventory system uses utilization data to update inventory on hand continually and this information is linked to purchasing and restocking, whereas a periodic inventory system counts inventory at some regular intervals (such as annually) and uses average utilization to set par levels. Summary On the basis of application of operational management concepts, ways of taking advantage of a perpetual inventory system to achieve savings in supply expenses are outlined. These include linking the operating room scheduling and supply order system, distributor-driven just-in-time delivery of case carts, continual updating of preference lists based on utilization patterns, increasing inventory turnovers, standardizing surgical practices, and vendor consignment of high unit-cost items such as implants. In addition, Lean principles of visual management and elimination of eight wastes may be applicable to supply management.

TI  - Detection, classification, and mapping of U.S. traffic signs using google street view images for roadway inventory management
DO  - 10.1186/S40327-015-0027-1
PY  - 2015///
AB  - BackgroundMaintaining an up-to-date record of the number, type, location, and condition of high-quantity low-cost roadway assets such as traffic signs is critical to transportation inventory management systems. While, databases such as Google Street View contain street-level images of all traffic signs and are updated regularly, their potential for creating an inventory databases has not been fully explored. The key benefit of such databases is that once traffic signs are detected, their geographic coordinates can also be derived and visualized within the same platform.MethodsBy leveraging Google Street View images, this paper presents a new system for creating inventories of traffic signs. Using computer vision method, traffic signs are detected and classified into four categories of regulatory, warning, stop, and yield signs by processing images extracted from Google Street View API. Considering the discriminative classification scores from all images that see a sign, the most probable location of each traffic sign is derived and shown on the Google Maps using a dynamic heat map. A data card containing information about location and type of each detected traffic sign is also created. Finally, several data mining interfaces are introduced that allow for better management of the traffic sign inventories.ResultsThe experiments conducted on 6.2 miles of I-57 and I-74 interstate highways in the U.S. –with an average accuracy of 94.63 % for sign classification– show the potential of the method to provide quick, inexpensive, and automatic access to asset inventory information.ConclusionsGiven the reliability in performance shown through experiments and because collecting information from Google Street View imagery is cost-effective, the proposed method has potential to deliver inventory information on traffic signs in a timely fashion and tie into the existing DOT inventory management systems. Such spatio-temporal representations provide DOTs with information on how different types of traffic signs degrade over time and further provides useful condition information necessary for predicting sign replacement plan.

TI  - Inventory Management with Advance Demand Information and Flexible Delivery
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.1070.0831
PY  - 2008///
AB  - This paper considers inventory models with advance demand information and flexible delivery. Customers place their orders in advance, and delivery is flexible in the sense that early shipment is allowed. Specifically, an order placed at time t by a customer with demand lead time T should be fulfilled by period t + T; failure to fulfill it within the time window [t, t + T] is penalized. We consider two situations: (1) Customer demand lead times are homogeneous and demand arriving in period t is a scalar dt to be satisfied within T periods. We show that state-dependent (s, S) policies are optimal, where the state represents advance demands outside the supply lead-time horizon. We find that increasing the demand lead time is more beneficial than decreasing the supply lead time. (2) Customers are heterogeneous in their demand lead times. In this case, demands are vectors and may exhibit crossover, necessitating an allocation decision in addition to the ordering decision. We develop a lower-bound approximation based on an allocation assumption, and propose protection-level heuristics that yield upper bounds on the optimal cost. Numerical analysis quantifies the optimality gaps of the heuristics (2% on average for the best heuristic) and the benefit of delivery flexibility (14% on average using the best heuristic), and provides insights into when the heuristics perform the best and when flexibility is most beneficial.

TI  - Supporting large-area, sample-based forest inventories with very high spatial resolution satellite imagery
DO  - 10.1177/0309133309342643
PY  - 2009///
AB  - Information needs associated with forest management and reporting requires data with a steadily increasing level of detail and temporal frequency. Remote sensing satellites commonly used for forest monitoring (eg, Landsat, SPOT) typically collect imagery with sufficient temporal frequency, but lack the requisite spatial and categorical detail for some forest inventory information needs. Aerial photography remains a principal data source for forest inventory; however, information extraction is primarily accomplished through manual processes. The spatial, categorical, and temporal information requirements of large-area forest inventories can be met through sample-based data collection. Opportunities exist for very high spatial resolution (VHSR; ie, <1 m) remotely sensed imagery to augment traditional data sources for large-area, sample-based forest inventories, especially for inventory update. In this paper, we synthesize the state-of-the-art in the use of VHSR remotely sensed imagery for forest inventory and monitoring. Based upon this review, we develop a framework for updating a sample-based, large-area forest inventory that incorporates VHSR imagery. Using the information needs of the Canadian National Forest Inventory (NFI) for context, we demonstrate the potential capabilities of VHSR imagery in four phases of the forest inventory update process: stand delineation, automated attribution, manual interpretation, and indirect attribute modelling. Although designed to support the information needs of the Canadian NFI, the framework presented herein could be adapted to support other sample-based, large-area forest monitoring initiatives.

TI  - An RFID-based remote monitoring system for enterprise internal production management
DO  - 10.1007/S00170-006-0506-6
PY  - 2007///
AB  - The disconnected flow of inventory and information will lead to a lack of real-time information and a build-up of excess inventory to buffer uncertainties in supply and demand. In this paper, a radio frequency identification (RFID) based remote monitoring system over the Internet is proposed to provide a transparent and visible information flow for supply chain and enterprise internal resource management. RFID technology has been a hot technology to replace barcodes in supply chain management in recent years. Actually, it has been successfully applied by the US Army in military logistics in 1991. Recently, the superman of the supermarket, Wal-Mart, mandates that its top 100 suppliers must equip RFID tags on their supplied items. However, RFID technology is still not a standard form acceptable for global use. The first big problem is to select a global universal radio frequency (RF) for active and passive RFID systems, but because of the advantages of RFID technology, it is unassailable that it will be popularly used in various fields very soon, such as supply chain management, enterprise resources planning (ERP), sales management, and so on. In this paper, the RFID-based monitoring system for enterprise internal production management is introduced. The RFID technology, Bluetooth, and Internet technology are employed to form a remote system for the monitoring of the production status of a factory. Based on this system, the management department can transparently master and control the status of the production line and supply chain, including raw materials and outsourcing supply/consumption status, production status of parts and components, production status of the finished products, etc. This system will be of benefit to greatly improve the productivity and reduce the cost for the enterprise.

TI  - A Continuous-Review Inventory Model with Disruptions at Both Supplier and Retailer
DO  - 10.1111/J.1937-5956.2009.01026.X
PY  - 2009///
AB  - We consider a continuous-review inventory problem for a retailer who faces random disruptions both internally and externally (from its supplier). We formulate the expected inventory cost at this retailer and analyze the properties of the cost function. In particular, we show that the cost function is quasi-convex and therefore can be efficiently optimized to numerically find the optimal order size from the retailer to the supplier. Computational experiments provide additional insight into the problem. In addition, we introduce an effective approximation of the cost function. Our approximation can be solved in closed form, which is useful when the model is embedded into more complicated supply chain design or management models.

TI  - An Objective Method for the Assessment of Psychological and Social Problems Among Epileptics
DO  - 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1980.tb04053.x
PY  - 1980///
AB  - Summary: Numerous investigators have identified psychological and social problems among epileptics and in many instances these appear to be more debilitating than the seizures themselves. However, assessment of these problems has most frequently been done by subjective means and when objective tests have been used, they were almost always developed for and standardized on populations other than epileptics. The development of the Washington Psychosocial Seizure Inventory (WPSI) is presented in this paper. After pilot work, 127 adult epileptics were evaluated for psychosocial problems and they completed the 132‐item Inventory. Professional assessment of difficulties was made with respect to family background, emotional adjustment, interpersonal adjustment, vocational adjustment, financial status, adjustment to seizures, and medical management. Finally, an assessment of overall psychosocial functioning was made. Through an item‐by‐item correlation technique, scales were empirically developed for each of these areas and a profile was produced which gives both the absolute and the relative extents of difficulties for each patient with respect to each area. Potential applications for the WPSI are presented.

TI  - Real-time disruption management in a two-stage production and inventory system
DO  - 10.1080/07408170490245379
PY  - 2004///
AB  - This paper presents a general disruption management approach for a two-stage production and inventory control system. A penalty cost for deviations of the new plan from the original plan is incorporated and the concept of a disruption recovery time window is introduced. We define two classes of problems: one with fixed setup epochs and another with flexible setup epochs. With linear or quadratic penalty functions for production/ordering quantity change and fixed setup epochs, the best recovery plan is obtained by solving a quadratic mathematical programming problem. With convex penalty functions for quantity changes and flexible setup epochs, it is shown that the second stage orders have identical order quantities within each production cycle. Therefore, in a lot-for-lot system, the ordering and production quantities for both stages are the same. As a special case, we consider disruption recovery problems with short time windows spanning one or two production cycles. We also discuss solution procedures for both major and minor disruption problems and give an extension for the case of multiple retailers. Throughout the paper managerial insights are presented that indicate how a company should respond to various types of disruptions during its operations.

TI  - The forest inventory and analysis sampling frame
PY  - 2005///
AB  - Addendum: The supplementary documents referenced in this manuscript are posted on the Web site https://www.fia.fs.fed.us/library/sampling/index.phpFor purposes of sampling and estimation, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) subdivides the total land area of the United States into mutually exclusive populations and subpopulations. Populations are usually defined by county boundaries or by public ownerships that may or may not cross county boundaries (e.g., national forests). In cases where the sample size for individual counties is insufficient, groups of counties may be combined into a super-county to form a single population with adequate sample size. Based on user request, counties occasionally are split into subpopulations to accommodate enumerated (known) acreages supplied by public agencies (e.g., National Forest System and The Bureau of Land Management). This is done to ensure that FIA totals match the county-level acreages reported by the requesting agencies. Each FIA population and subpopulation has a known number of plots and a known area of land, obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau, from which population estimates are derived. Each is sampled and processed as a separate entity, so estimates of grand totals and their variances for groups of populations and subpopulations are additive. For example, State-level estimates are obtained by totaling the estimates from all populations and subpopulations bounded by the State.

TI  - Forecasting and Inventory Management of Short Life-Cycle Products
DO  - 10.1287/opre.44.1.131
PY  - 1996///
AB  - In this paper, we provide an integrated framework for forecasting and inventory management of short life-cycle products. The literature on forecasting and inventory management does not adequately address issues relating to short life-cycle products. We first propose a growth model that can be used to obtain accurate monthly forecasts for the entire life cycle of the product. The model avoids limiting data requirements of traditional methods. Instead, it extracts relevant information from past product histories and utilizes the information on total life-cycle sales and the peak sales timing. Using disguised demand data from a personal computer PC manufacturer, we validate the model. Next, we model the inventory management problem for the short life-cycle environment. The uncertainty in demand is modeled through the uncertainty in the realized values of the parameters of the forecasting model. The high cost of terminal inventory, shortages, and rapidly changing procurement costs are all included in the model. Extensions to the basic model are also developed. Using optimal control theory, we derive a solution that provides valuable information on procurement cutoff time and terminal service levels. A detailed example explains the characteristics of the policy and its relevance in decision making. Many of the issues covered in the models were brought to our attention while implementing a forecasting model at a PC manufacturer. The benchmark monthly forecasts and the associated inventory levels provide information that can be very helpful in planning and controlling marketing, sales, and production.

TI  - Molecular-structure-based models of chemical inventories using neural networks.
DO  - 10.1021/ES7022362
PY  - 2008///
AB  - Chemical synthesis is a complex and diverse procedure, and production data are often scarce or incomplete. A detailed inventory analysis of all mass and energy flows necessary for the production of chemicals is often costly and time-intensive. Therefore only few chemical inventories exist, even though they are essential for process optimization and the environmental assessment of many products. This paper introduces a newtype of model to provide estimates for inventory data and environmental impacts of chemical production based on the molecular structure of a chemical and without a priori knowledge of the production process. These molecular-structure-based models offer inventory data for users in process design and optimization, screening life cycle assessment (LCA), and supply chain management. They can be applied even if the producer is unknown or the production process is not documented. We assessed the capabilities of linear regression and neural network models for this purpose. All models were generated with a data set of inventory data on 103 chemicals. Different input sets were chosen as ways to transform the chemical structure into a numerical vector of descriptors and the effectiveness of the different input sets was analyzed. The results show that a correctly developed neural network model can perform on an acceptable level for many purposes. The models can assist process developers to improve energy efficiency in all design stages and aid in LCA and supply chain management by filling data gaps.

TI  - Inventory-based dispatching of automated guided vehicles on container terminals
DO  - 10.1007/s00291-006-0033-8
PY  - 2006///
AB  - This paper deals with automated guided vehicles (AGVs) which transport containers between the quay and the stack on automated container terminals. The focus is on the assignment of transportation jobs to AGVs within a terminal control system operating in real time. First, we describe a rather common problem formulation based on due times for the jobs and solve this problem both with a greedy priority rule based heuristic and with an exact algorithm. Subsequently, we present an alternative formulation of the assignment problem, which does not include due times. This formulation is based on a rough analogy to inventory management and is solved using an exact algorithm. The idea behind this alternative formulation is to avoid estimates of driving times, completion times, due times, and tardiness because such estimates are often highly unreliable in practice and do not allow for accurate planning. By means of simulation, we then analyze the different approaches. We show that the inventory-based model leads to better productivity on the terminal than the due-time-based formulation.

AB  - In this paper we consider a centralized logistics system in which a single company owns the production facility and the set of retailers and establishes warehouses that will replenish the retailers' inventories. We analyze the potential savings that the company will achieve by allowing its retailers to be sourced by more than one warehouse probabilistically, through the use of information technology. We facilitate the discussion on the impact of multisourcing by introducing a capacitated location-inventory model that minimizes the sum of the fixed warehouse location costs, the transportation costs, and the inventory costs. The model is formulated as a nonlinear integer-programming problem that has a cost term that is neither concave nor convex. We propose a Lagrangian relaxation solution algorithm to solve the model and successfully test the algorithm on problems with 88 and 150 retailers. Based on the model properties and the sensitivity analysis results, we conclude that multisourcing becomes a more valuable option as transportation costs increase, i.e., constitute a larger portion of the total logistics cost. In addition, we show that in practice only a small portion of the retailers need to be multisourced to achieve significant cost savings.

TI  - Managing the Reverse Channel with RFID‐Enabled Negative Demand Information
DO  - 10.1111/J.1937-5956.2007.TB00285.X
PY  - 2009///
AB  - We analyze the inventory decisions of a manufacturer who has ample production capacity and also uses returned products to satisfy customer demand. All returned items go through an evaluation process, at the end of which the decision of disposal, direct reselling, or rework is made for each unit according to a predetermined procedure. We quantify the value of information/visibility on the reverse channel for the manufacturer by making comparisons among three approaches: No information-naive; no visibility-enlightened; and full visibility. We find the value of visibility increases with the comparative length of the reverse channel and volume, volatility, and usability of returns. Furthermore, the smarter the manufacturer, the less benefit visibility brings to the system. By this analysis, we quantify the visibility savings of radio frequency identification (RFID) in the reverse channel as a candidate enabler technology. We also provide numerical examples to show that practical approximations in inventory management may have acceptable penalties to the manufacturer with visibility.

TI  - The Effect of Information Precision and Information Reliability on Manufacturer-Retailer Relationships
DO  - 10.2308/ACCR.2002.77.3.653
PY  - 2002///
AB  - This study investigates the extent to which a retailer's willingness to share internal (sales and inventory) information with a manufacturer and the reliability of the information transmission between the retailer and the manufacturer affect the total supply‐chain profits resulting from two alternative inventory management systems. I present analytical models of a traditional system and a Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) system. The VMI system is a supply‐chain management technique in which the retailer delegates its inventory decisions to, and shares its internal accounting information with, the manufacturer. With VMI, the parties aim to reduce inventory‐related costs and increase supply‐chain profits. The theoretical analysis indicates that the system that produces higher supply‐chain profits depends on the extent to which the retailer reveals its internal accounting information to the manufacturer and the ability of the manufacturer to accurately receive and use this information in its decisions.

TI  - A new approach of forecasting intermittent demand for spare parts inventories in the process industries
DO  - 10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602119
PY  - 2007///
AB  - Accurate demand forecasting is of vital importance in inventory management of spare parts in process industries, while the intermittent nature makes demand forecasting for spare parts especially difficult. With the wide application of information technology in enterprise management, more information and data are now available to improve forecasting accuracy. In this paper, we develop a new approach for forecasting the intermittent demand of spare parts. The described approach provides a mechanism to integrate the demand autocorrelated process and the relationship between explanatory variables and the nonzero demand of spare parts during forecasting occurrences of nonzero demands over lead times. Two types of performance measures for assessing forecast methods are also described. Using data sets of 40 kinds of spare parts from a petrochemical enterprise in China, we show that our method produces more accurate forecasts of lead time demands than do exponential smoothing, Croston's method and Markov bootstrapping method.

DO  - 10.1044/1092-4388(2005/035)
PY  - 2005///
AB  - Nineteen adults who stutter participated in a 3-week intensive stuttering modification treatment program (the Successful Stuttering Management Program [SSMP]). A series of 14 fluency and affective-based measures were assessed before treatment, immediately after treatment, and 6 months after treatment. Measures included stuttering frequency; the Stuttering Severity Instrument for Children and Adults, Third Edition (SSI-3); a self-rating of stuttering severity; the Perceptions of Stuttering Inventory (PSI); the Locus of Control of Behavior Scale; the Beck Depression Inventory; the Multicomponent Anxiety Inventory IV (MCAI-IV); and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Statistically significant improvements were observed on 4 of the total 14 measures immediately following treatment and on 4 measures at 6 months posttreatment. Statistically significant improvements observed immediately posttreatment included scores on the SSI and the Struggle, Avoidance, and Expectancy subscales of the PSI. Sustained statistically significant improvements at 6 months posttreatment were observed only on client-reported perceptions of stuttering (the Avoidance and Expectancy subscales of the PSI) and 2 specific affective functioning measures (the Psychic and Somatic Anxiety subscales of the MCAI-IV). The SSMP generated some anxiolytic effects but was ineffective in producing durable reductions of core stuttering behaviors, such as stuttering frequency and severity. The discussion focuses on the strengths, weaknesses, and durability of the SSMP treatment approach.

DO  - 10.1080/17517575.2011.566630
PY  - 2011///
AB  - The integrated medical supply inventory control system introduced in this study is a hybrid system that is shaped by the nature of medical supply, usage and storage capacity limitations of health care facilities. The system links demand, service provided at the clinic, health care service provider's information, inventory storage data and decision support tools into an integrated information system. ABC analysis method, economic order quantity model, two-bin method and safety stock concept are applied as decision support models to tackle inventory management issues at health care facilities. In the decision support module, each medical item and storage location has been scrutinised to determine the best-fit inventory control policy. The pilot case study demonstrates that the integrated medical supply information system holds several advantages for inventory managers, since it entails benefits of deploying enterprise information systems to manage medical supply and better patient services.

TI  - An Improved Formulation of Hybrid Model Predictive Control With Application to Production-Inventory Systems
DO  - 10.1109/TCST.2011.2177525
PY  - 2013///
AB  - We consider an improved model predictive control (MPC) formulation for linear hybrid systems described by mixed logical dynamical (MLD) models. The algorithm relies on a multiple-degree-of-freedom parametrization that enables the user to adjust the speed of setpoint tracking, measured disturbance rejection and unmeasured disturbance rejection independently in the closed-loop system. Consequently, controller tuning is more flexible and intuitive than relying on objective function weights (such as move suppression) traditionally used in MPC schemes. The controller formulation is motivated by the needs of nontraditional control applications that are suitably described by hybrid production-inventory systems. Two applications are considered in this paper: adaptive, time-varying interventions in behavioral health, and inventory management in supply chains under conditions of limited capacity. In the adaptive intervention application, a hypothetical intervention inspired by the Fast Track program, a real-life preventive intervention for reducing conduct disorder in at-risk children, is examined. In the inventory management application, the ability of the algorithm to judiciously alter production capacity under conditions of varying demand is presented. These case studies demonstrate that MPC for hybrid systems can be tuned for desired performance under demanding conditions involving noise and uncertainty.

TI  - Skills, knowledge and competencies for managing construction refurbishment works
DO  - 10.1080/014461999371808
PY  - 1999///
AB  - An appropriate body of management skills and knowledge for construction refurbishment is established: a skills and knowledge inventory. Of the 75 types of management skill and knowledge, the six most important are leadership, communication (oral/written), motivation of others, health and safety, decision making, and forecasting and planning. Refurbishment managers' jobs as defined by their application of skills/knowledge are, on the whole, homogeneous, with some overlap across levels of management and types of organization, and this dispels the view that management tasks are totally different across management strata. A comparison of the relative importance of management skills/knowledge for refurbishment and management skills for general construction shows that the skills/knowledge associated with forecasting and planning, managing conflict and crisis, tenant welfare, team building, and decision making are higher than in general construction management; reflecting the uncertain nature and the relatively higher levels of risks associated with refurbishment works.

TI  - Selecting the best periodic inventory control and demand forecasting methods for low demand items
DO  - 10.1057/PALGRAVE.JORS.2600418
PY  - 1997///
AB  - The (s,S) form of the periodic review inventory control system has been claimed theoretically to be the best for the management of items of low and intermittent demand. Various heuristic procedures have been put forward, usually justified on the basis of generated data with known properties. Some stock controllers also have other simple rules which they employ and which are rarely seen in the literature. Determining how to forecast future demands is also a major problem in the area. The research described in this paper compares various periodic inventory policies as well as some forecasting methods and attempts to determine which are best for low and intermittent demand items. It evaluates the alternative methods on some long series of daily demands for low demand items for a typical spare parts depot.

TI  - Inventory Management for an Assembly System with Product or Component Returns
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.1050.0394
PY  - 2005///
AB  - This paper considers an inventory system with an assembly structure. In addition to uncertain customer demands, the system experiences uncertain returns from customers. Some of the components in the returned products can be recovered and reused, and these units are returned to inventory. Returns complicate the structure of the system, so that the standard approach (based on reduction to an equivalent series system) no longer applies in general. We identify conditions on the item-recovery pattern and restrictions on the inventory policy under which an equivalent series system does exist. For the special case where only the end product (or all items used to assemble the end product) is recovered, we show that the system is equivalent to a series system with no policy restrictions. For the general case, we explain how and why the system becomes more problematic and propose two heuristic policies. The heuristics are easy to compute and practical to implement, and they perform well in numerical trials. Based on these numerical trials, we obtain insights into the impact of various factors on system performance. For example, we find that holding and backorder costs tend to increase when the average return rate, the variability of returns, or the number of components recovered increases. However, neither the product architecture nor the specific set of components being recovered seems to have a significant impact on these costs. Whether product recovery reduces total system costs depends on the magnitude of the additional holding and backorder costs relative to potential procurement cost savings.

PY  - 2010///
AB  - Abstract: Forest inventory and forest mapping can be considered as monitoring and assessment applications that respond to different demands. However, the integration of mapping and inventory provides an effective framework for the support of forest management from multiple perspectives: (i) use of thematic maps for stratifying the inventory sample for the purpose of improving the precision of inventory estimates; (ii) coupling remotely sensed and sample inventory data for the purpose of constructing maps of inventoried forest attributes; (iii) coupling remotely sensed data and sample inventory data for the purpose of improving the precision of the inventory estimates; (iv) using inventory data as prior information to support thematic mapping; and (v) using inventory data to correct map areal estimates. This paper aims to provide general considerations on this integration issue in the form of a scientific review and commentary discussion.

DO  - 10.1109/EMR.2003.24939
PY  - 2003///
AB  - The beneÞts of dynamic pricing methods have long been known in industries, such as airlines, hotels and electric utilities, where the capacity is Þxed in the short-term and perishable. In recent years, there has been an increasing adoption of dynamic pricing policies in retail and other industries as well, where the sellers have the ability to store inventory. Three factors contributed to this phenomenon: the increased availability of demand data, the ease of changing prices due to new techologies, and the availability of decision-support tools for analyzing demand data and for dynamic pricing. This paper constitutes a review of the literature and current practices in dynamic pricing. Given its applicability in most markets and its increasing adoption in practice, our focus is on dynamic (intertemporal) pricing in the presence of inventory considerations.

DO  - 10.1111/j.1475-3995.2005.00492.x
PY  - 2005///
AB  - One of the important aspects of supply chain management is inventory management because the cost of inventories in a supply chain accounts for about 30% of the value of the product. The main focus of this work is to study the performance of a single-product serial supply chain operating with a base-stock policy and to optimize the inventory (i.e. base stock) levels in the supply chain so as to minimize the total supply chain cost (TSCC), comprising holding and shortage costs at all the installations in the supply chain. A genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to optimize the base-stock levels with the objective of minimizing the sum of holding and shortage costs in the entire supply chain. Simulation is used to evaluate the base-stock levels generated by the GA. The proposed GA is evaluated with the consideration of a variety of supply chain settings in order to test for its robustness of performance across different supply chain scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed GA (in terms of generating base-stock levels with minimum TSCC) is compared with that of a random search procedure. In addition, optimal base-stock levels are obtained through complete enumeration of the solution space and compared with those yielded by the GA. It is found that the solutions generated by the proposed GA do not significantly differ from the optimal solution obtained through complete enumeration for different supply chain settings, thereby showing the effectiveness of the proposed GA.

PY  - 1988///
AB  - Monahan Monahan, J. P. 1984. A quantity discount pricing model to increase vendor profits. Management Sci. June 720-726. adapted the quantity discount model of inventory theory to the problem of determining an optimal quantity discount schedule from a vendor's point of view, and opened up an important direction of research. However, his one-item, one-customer, one-vendor model is based on several implicit assumptions that must be judged unreasonable. Monahan must account for the vendor's inventory carrying charges and redefine his variable S2. It is shown that a rational vendor's manufacturing frequency would not be identical to the buyer's ordering frequency if the vendor's manufacturing setup costs are substantially larger than the buyer's ordering costs. A numerical example presented in this note also questions the practical usefulness of Monahan's model even after its theoretical inaccuracies axe corrected. Monahan's model may explain discounts that are a fraction of 1% of the price of an item, but it fails to explain commonly observed magnitudes of quantity discounts, such as 10% of the unit price.

TI  - Competitive Supply Chain Inventory Management
DO  - 10.1007/978-1-4615-4949-9_5
PY  - 1999///
AB  - Most supply chains are composed of independent agents with individual preferences. These agents could be distinct firms or they could even be managers within a single firm. In either case, it is expected that no single agent has control over the entire supply chain, and hence no agent has the power to optimize the supply chain. It is also reasonable to assume that each agent will attempt to optimize his own preference, knowing that all of the other agents will do the same. Will this competitive behavior lead the agents to choose policies that optimize overall supply chain performance? The answer is usually “no”, due to supply chain externalities. An externality occurs whenever the action of one agent impacts another agent. For example, suppose agent i’s action benefits agent j). Agent i will tend to do too little of that action because he does not consider the full benefit of the action on the supply chain (assuming increasing that action is costly to agent i). Similarly, suppose agent i’s action confers an additional cost on agent j. In this case agent i will tend to do too much of that action. As will be discussed, many externalities exist in supply chain operations.

TI  - A lateral transshipment model for perishable inventory management
DO  - 10.1080/00207543.2017.1312587
PY  - 2017///
AB  - Since inventory costs account for half of logistics costs, optimal inventory management to minimise total inventory costs remains a sustainable competitive advantage. Lateral transshipment (LT) is evidently a proven strategy to minimise total inventory costs. The additional LT costs are more than compensated by lowering the stock-out costs. Previous LT models have not been applied to perishable products. Our proposed LT model embodies spoilage costs in the total inventory costs function with the other cost components (purchase from a regular supplier, LT, backordering and holding), and optimises the trade-off among these five key cost components. Numerical examples from a supermarket chain case study demonstrate that, as compared against the no or lower spoilage costs scenarios, lower LT costs are required to trigger the decision point for implementing LT in the higher spoilage costs scenario. However, common to both the with and without spoilage costs scenarios, LT is still the preferred strategy to minimise total inventory costs, given the decision rules are satisfied.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions from cities: comparison of international inventory frameworks
DO  - 10.1080/13549839.2012.660909
PY  - 2012///
AB  - Credibly and consistently reporting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cities and urban areas enables policy-makers and practitioners to contribute to addressing the challenge of climate change by meeting mitigation targets, and is critical to overall good municipal management. Good reporting allows for transparency, verification, and replication over time. This study provides an understanding of the GHG emissions inventory protocols and methodologies as they apply to cities. Though the inventories generally use common terminology, the differences in inventorying approaches are many, and the implications of the inventorying results at the city level are important to climate change policy and decision-makers. A compilation of GHG emissions inventory protocols is developed along with an analysis of their characteristics and inherent differences. Seven protocols are investigated: four are applied to Shanghai's community emissions; four to New York City's corporate emissions (i.e. those from municipal activities); and two to the reporting of Paris' emissions, including upstream components. The results show a significant degree of variability among the protocols.

TI  - Simulation of Order Fulfillment in Divergent Assembly Supply Chains
PY  - 1998///
AB  - Management of supply chains is a difficult task involving coordination and decision-making across organizational boundaries. Computational modeling using multi-agent simulation is a tool that can provide decision support for supply chain managers. We identify the components of a supply chain model and implement it in the Swarm multi-agent simulation platform. The model is used to study the impact of information sharing on order fulfillment in divergent assembly supply chains (commonly associated with the computer and electronics industries). We find that efficient information sharing enables inventory costs to be reduced while maintaining acceptable order fulfillment cycle times. This is true because information, which provides the basis for enhanced coordination and reduced uncertainty, can substitute for inventory.

TI  - Patterns of Socially Desirable Responding Among Perpetrators and Victims of Wife Assault
DO  - 10.1891/0886-6708.7.1.29
PY  - 1992///
AB  - Wife assaulters attending a treatment group and women who had just exited an abusive relationship were asked to report on the extent of physical violence and emotional abuse in their relationship. Measures of socially desirable responding (SDR) were administered to both groups. Wife assaulters' self-reports of physical abuse correlated negatively with one SDR measure (the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding) but not another (the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale); emotional abuse correlated negatively with both measures. Although physical abuse was primarily related to impression management, psychological abuse was affected by both impression management and self-deception aspects of SDR. Wife assaulters' reports of their own anger also correlated negatively with SDR. Both self-deception and impression management appear to contribute to underreporting of anger. Finally, abuse victims' reports of both physical and emotional abuse were unrelated to SDR.

DO  - 10.1108/13598541211212861
PY  - 2012///
AB  - Purpose – Managing perishable inventories is a trade‐off of shortages and lost sales against wastage. This paper aims to identify what drives good management of perishables within the supply chain using the example of blood inventory management in hospitals.Design/methodology/approach – Seven case studies with hospital transfusion laboratories in the UK blood supply chain were carried out in order to explore how perishable inventories are managed. The case studies identify drivers for good performance in perishable inventories.Findings – Six recommendations are developed for how managers can improve perishable inventory performance. These are based around simple management procedures implemented by experienced staff. The case studies develop three propositions that recommend how inventory theory should be embedded in practice.Research limitations/implications – This research demonstrates that managerial changes and training issues have a significant impact on waste reduction and inventory management perfo...

TI  - The “physics” of capacity and backlog management in service and custom manufacturing supply chains
DO  - 10.1002/SDR.319
PY  - 2005///
AB  - In this paper, we investigate the dynamic behavior of service supply chains in the presence of varying demand and information sharing. Each stage holds no finished goods inventory, rather only backlogs that can be managed solely by adjusting capacity. These conditions reflect the reality of many service (and custom manufacturing, such as capital equipment) supply chains. While there is a growing literature on finished goods inventory management in supply chains, relatively little research exists on managing capacity in the absence of finished goods inventory. To address this problem, we develop a capacity management model for a serial chain. At each stage in the supply chain, our model relates capacity, processing, backlog, and service delays to capture the aggregate dynamic interactions between the different stages. Using a system dynamics simulation model in an experimental design as well as a formal analysis of a simplified, yet representative, model using control theory and signal analysis techniques, we characterize the conditions under which a “bullwhip effect” (i.e., an increase in demand and backlog variability as one looks up the supply chain) can occur. We then study the impact of different management strategies and levels of information visibility on capacity and service delay variability in a two-stage model. Conventional wisdom, derived from studies of make-to-stock manufacturing supply chains, strongly supports lead-time reduction in order to mitigate the bullwhip effect. We show that lead-time reduction can exacerbate the bullwhip effect in a service or custom manufacturing setting if it is not carefully coordinated with capacity adjustment. In particular, lead-time reduction generally reduces backlog variance locally but often increases backlog variances at higher stages. Further, sharing end-customer demand reduces backlog variances as in inventory supply chains but over-reliance on it relative to local information may actually increase demand variance at higher stages. Finally, we show that the natural tendency to pursue system-wide process improvement by imposing uniform parameter targets across the supply chain exacerbates demand, capacity, and backlog variances at higher stages. Instead, we show that a superior policy is asymmetric, holding the bulk of system backlog at the stage closest to the point of end customer demand. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - An Operational Model for Empty Container Management
DO  - 10.1057/PALGRAVE.MEL.9100136
PY  - 2005///
AB  - This paper proposes a mathematical programming approach for empty container management. Since directional imbalances in trade activities result in a surplus or shortage of empty containers in ports and depots, their management can be thought of as a min cost flow problem whose arcs represent services routes, inventory links and decisions concerning the time and place to lease containers from external sources. We adopt an hourly time-step in a dynamic network and, although this time-period generates large-size instances, the two implemented algorithms show a good computational efficiency. A possible case study of the Mediterranean basin is proposed and results are presented with a graphical representation, providing a useful support to decision-makers in the field.

DO  - 10.1108/02635570810868353
PY  - 2008///
AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to explore the impact of inventory system inaccuracies on the benefits of collaborative supply chain practices under various supply chain scenarios. To achieve this purpose, two popular collaboration initiatives are considered in a four‐stage supply chain. The first practice is a vendor managed inventory program where the distributor takes the full responsibility of managing the retailer's inventory. The second practice is a collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment program where all members work together to plan, forecast, and replenish the product.Design/methodology/approach – The study utilizes Monte Carlo computer simulation in an experimental design.Findings – The analysis suggests that while the inaccurate inventory records result in significant performance reductions for all supply chain configurations, their impact is substantially greater for the supply chains where members collaborate more closely on key supply chain management activities. In addition, the ...

TI  - Grocery Perishables Management
DO  - 10.1111/J.1937-5956.2011.01288.X
PY  - 2012///
AB  - In this article, we study the joint pricing and inventory control problem for perishables when a retailer does not sell new and old inventory at the same time. At the beginning of a period, the retailer makes replenishment and pricing decisions, and at the end of a period, the retailer decides whether to dispose of ending inventory or carry it forward to the next period. The objective of the retailer is to maximize the long-run average profit. Assuming zero lead time, we propose an efficient solution approach to the problem, which is also generalized to solve three extensions to the basic model. A feature of the present study is that we consider explicitly the influence of perishability on the demand. Among the insights gathered from the numerical analysis, we find that dynamic pricing aids extending shelf life and when disposal incurs a lower cost, or even a positive salvage value, the retailer is induced to dispose earlier since the benefit of selling new inventory offsets the loss due to disposal. We also observe that the faster the perceived rate of deterioration, the lower the threshold of the ending inventory for disposal. Perhaps a bit counter-intuitive, maximizing profits does not mean eliminating disposals or expirations.

TI  - Inventory Management for an Assembly System Subject to Supply Disruptions
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.1120.1660
PY  - 2013///
AB  - We consider an assembly system with a single end product and a general assembly structure, where one or more of the component suppliers or (sub)assembly production processes is subject to random supply disruptions. We present a method for reducing the system to an equivalent system with some subsystems replaced by a series structure. This reduction simplifies the computation of optimal ordering policies and can also allow for comparison of disruption impacts across systems with different supply chain structures. We identify conditions under which a state-dependent echelon base-stock policy is optimal. Based on this result, we propose a heuristic policy for solving the assembly system with disruptions and test its performance in numerical trials. Using additional numerical trials, we explore a variety of strategic questions. For example, contrary to what is typically observed in systems without disruptions, we find that choosing a supplier with a longer lead time can sometimes yield lower system costs. We also find that backup supply is more valuable for a supplier with a shorter lead time than one with a longer lead time. In addition, because of component complementarities, we find that choosing suppliers whose disruptions are perfectly correlated yields lower system costs than choosing suppliers whose disruptions are independent, in contrast to the strategy that is typically preferred when choosing backup suppliers for a single product. This paper was accepted by Gerard P. Cachon, operations management.

DO  - 10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265577
PY  - 2004///
AB  - Traditionally, culture has been assessed by qualitative methods. However, quantitative approaches such as culture surveys offer important advantages for both cross-sectional organizational research and knowledge-based cultural change initiatives. The organizational culture inventory/spl copy/ (OCI), an instrument designed for such uses, profiles the culture of organizations and their sub-units in terms of behavioral norms and expectations. Following a review of seminal concepts relevant to organizational culture, this paper presents a framework depicting the relationship between culture and outcomes that are consistent with successful KM environments. An examination of the data provided by approximately 60,000 OCI respondents indicates that the inventory is a powerful indicator of outcomes, which are related to both individual and organizational criteria.

DO  - 10.1111/POMS.12571
PY  - 2015///
AB  - Small-to-medium size enterprises (SMEs), including many startup firms, need to manage interrelated flows of cash and inventories of goods. In this paper, we model a firm that can finance its inventory (ordered or manufactured) with loans in order to meet random demand which in general may not be time stationary. The firm earns interest on its cash on hand and pays interest on its debt. The objective is to maximize the expected value of the firm’s capital at the end of a finite planning horizon. Our study shows that the optimal ordering policy is characterized by a pair of threshold variables for each period as function of the initial state of the period. Further, upper and lower bounds for the threshold values are developed using two simple-to-compute ordering policies. Based on these bounds, we provide an efficient algorithm to compute the two threshold values. Since the underlying state space is two-dimensional which leads to high computational complexity of the optimization algorithm, we also derive upper bounds for the optimal value function by reducing the optimization problem to one dimension. Subsequently, it is shown that policies of similar structure are optimal when the loan and deposit interest rates are piecewise linear functions, when there is a maximal loan limit and when unsatisfied demand is backordered. Finally, further managerial insights are provided with numerical studies.

TI  - Status and future of the forest health indicators program of the USA
DO  - 10.1007/s10661-010-1644-8
PY  - 2011///
AB  - For two decades, the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, has been charged with implementing a nationwide field-based forest health monitoring effort. Given its extensive nature, the monitoring program has been gradually implemented across forest health indicators and inventoried states. Currently, the Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis program has initiated forest health inventories in all states, and most forest health indicators are being documented in terms of sampling protocols, data management structures, and estimation procedures. Field data from most sample years and indicators are available on-line with numerous analytical examples published both internally and externally. This investment in national forest health monitoring has begun to yield dividends by allowing evaluation of state/regional forest health issues (e.g., pollution and invasive pests) and contributing substantially to national/international reporting efforts (e.g., National Report on Sustainability and US EPA Annual Greenhouse Gas Estimates). With the emerging threat of climate change, full national implementation and remeasurement of a forest health inventory should allow for more robust assessment of forest communities that are undergoing unprecedented changes, aiding future land management and policy decisions.

DO  - 10.1001/ARCHINTE.1991.00400110117023
PY  - 1991///
AB  - We describe the effectiveness of a stress management workshop designed for physicians. Of the 64 medicine, pediatrics, and medicine-pediatrics residents who agreed to participate in the workshop, the 43 who could be freed from clinical responsibilities constituted the intervention group; the 21 residents who could not be freed from clinical responsibilities were asked to be the nonintervention group. The ESSI Stress Systems Instrument and Maslach Burnout Inventory were administered to control subjects and workshop participants 2 weeks before and 6 weeks after the workshop. The half-day workshops taught management of the stresses of medical practice through: (1) learning and practicing interpersonal skills that increase the availability of social support; (2) prioritization of personal, work, and educational demands; (3) techniques to increase stamina and attend to self-care needs; (4) recognition and avoidance of maladaptive responses; and (5) positive outlook skills. Overall, the ESSI Stress Systems Instrument test scores for the workshop participants improved (+1.27), while the nonintervention group's mean scores declined (-0.65). All 21 individual ESSI Stress Systems Instrument scale items improved for the workshop, compared with eight of 21 items for the nonintervention group. The workshop group improved in the Maslach Burnout Inventory emotional exhaustion scale and deteriorated less than the nonintervention group in the depersonalization scale. We conclude that a modest, inexpensive stress management workshop was received positively, and can lead to significant short-term improvement in stress and burnout test scores for medicine and pediatrics residents.

TI  - The state and use of municipal tree inventories in Swedish municipalities – results from a national survey
DO  - 10.1007/s11252-018-0732-3
PY  - 2018///
AB  - Urban trees are an essential component of urban ecosystems, and management of this resource constitutes an essential element of urban open space management. However, municipal tree inventories in Sweden and elsewhere have received limited attention. It is unknown how common municipal tree inventories are in Sweden, factors governing whether a municipality has an inventory and what the inventories are used for. This study therefore sought to: Create an overview of the state of Swedish municipal tree inventories and determine how municipality size, green space budget and management organisation affect the presence and scope of municipal tree inventories. The research questions examined were: What is the current state of Swedish municipal tree inventories? and what affects the status of these municipal tree inventories? A survey with questions related to strategic and operational perspectives of municipal tree inventories, e.g. how they are conducted and used, together with questions relating to budget and potential use of consultants, was sent to all 290 Swedish municipalities. The response rate was 55.5%. The main findings were that municipality size affects whether a municipality has an urban tree inventory and that the municipal organisation form affects how inventories are used. The existence of an inventory also increased the probability of the municipality having a tree management plan. Based on these results we recommend further research related to strategic management perspectives of tree inventories.

PY  - 1989///
AB  - This study replicated our earlier study (Powell & Butterfield,1979) of the applicability of the androgyny concept to management and reanalyzed that data using a revised Bem Sex-Role Inventory. Reanalysis of our earlier data showed that the good manager was described as more androgynous and less masculine on the revised instrument than on the original instrument. However, the good manager was described as more masculine and less androgynous by some groups in the newer sample as compared with their counterparts in the earlier sample. Overall, despite a considerable increase in the proportion of women managers, male and female undergraduate and part-time graduate business students continued to describe the "good manager" as masculine rather than androgynous. Implications of the results for theory, practice, and training and development are discussed.

TI  - Positive vs. Negative Externalities in Inventory Management: Implications for Supply Chain Design
DO  - 10.1287/msom.1040.0058
PY  - 2005///
AB  - In this paper we analyze the impact of supply-side externalities existing among downstream retailers on supply chain performance. Namely, multiple retail firms face stochastic demand, purchase the product from the upstream wholesaler, and make stocking decisions that affect all other retailers in the same echelon. Two sources of inefficiencies exist in such a supply chain: One is double marginalization and the other is externalities among retailers. Whereas double marginalization always leads to inventory understocking at the retail echelon, we find that the implications of externalities are more complex, because different externalities can improve or deteriorate supply chain performance, relative to the situation without externalities.We show that the effect of externalities depends critically on whether the stocking decisions of retailers exhibit positive (complementarity) or negative (substitutability) externalities, and whether retailers are managed centrally or competitively. Under complementarity, competing retailers tend to understock the product (compared with the centralized inventory management at the retail level), thus aggravating the double-marginalization effect. This is the opposite of what happens under substitutability, where competing retailers tend to overstock the product, thus compensating for the double-marginalization effect. Hence, we conclude that supply chain coordination between retailers and the wholesaler is most important when there is downstream competition that exhibits complementarity. From the wholesaler's point of view, competition among retailers is preferable over centralization of retailers when externalities are negative, and vice versa when externalities are positive. Moreover, with competition on complements, both retailers and the wholesaler have incentives to coordinate the supply chain.

AB  - Discusses the variety of production control situations within process industries. Following a literature review, a typology is introduced which discriminates between two extreme types of process industries: batch/mix and process/flow businesses. Reviews the research in production and inventory control in each of the extreme types. Identifies a control framework for operations management in process/flow businesses. Notes that although detailed scheduling approaches for batch/mix businesses exist, a control framework for the latter is missing. Concludes that operations management in batch process industries needs considerable research attention.

TI  - Multiple Criteria ABC Analysis
DO  - 10.1108/EB054765
PY  - 1986///
AB  - Prioritising items for management attention has been advocated in operations management for a long time, normally using ABC analysis (inventory control). This focuses attention on the “A” category items to maximise managerial effectiveness. Empirical evidence shows that this is a reasonable rule for allocating scarce resource‐management time but presents difficulties when the manager has to take more than one important dimension of a situation into account. A joint criteria matrix is put forward within the ABC framework and an industrial application given. The joint criteria matrix has practical utility provided ranking on some scale of measurement is realistic. The appropriate number of categories must be defined by the user. Combining criteria will probably require different analytical approaches, e.g. goal programming or heuristic approaches. Utilisation of the matrix by managers can provide an explicit method for taking a range of criteria into account in the development of inventory policies.

TI  - Mixed-Integer Programming Approach for Short-Term Crude Oil Scheduling
DO  - 10.1021/IE030348D
PY  - 2004///
AB  - This work addresses the problem of crude oil inventory management of a real-world refinery that receives several types of oil that are delivered through a pipeline. The problem involves transfers from the pipeline to the crude tanks, settling time constraints for separating brine from the oil, interface separation between different types of oil, and charges to the crude distillation units. The short-term scheduling problem is represented as mixed-integer programming models that rely on a continuous-time formulation. The main objective is to maintain a target crude oil load while minimizing the crude tank farm operating cost subject to crude oil fluctuations in terms of quantity and quality. Property calculations yield a set of nonlinear constraints. Two formulations are developed:  the first one relies on a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model, and the second adopts a discretization procedure for the inventory levels of the tank farm, thus generating a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) ...

TI  - Strategic Management of Distressed Inventory
DO  - 10.3401/POMS.1080.0043
PY  - 2008///
AB  - It is well known that maximizing revenue from a fixed stock of perishable goods may require discounting prices rather than allowing unsold inventory to perish. This behavior is seen in industries ranging from fashion retail to tour packages and baked goods. A number of authors have addressed the markdown management problem in which a seller seeks to determine the optimal sequence of discounts to maximize the revenue from a fixed stock of perishable goods. However, merchants who consistently use markdown policies risk training customers to “wait for the sale.” We investigate models in which the decision to sell inventory at a discount will change the future expectations of customers and hence their buying behavior. We show that, in equilibrium, a single-price policy is optimal if all consumers are strategic and demand is known to the seller. Relaxing any of these conditions can lead to a situation in which a two-price markdown policy is optimal. We show using numerical simulation that if customers update their expectations of availability over time, then optimal sales limit policies can evolve in a complex fashion.

TI  - The Revised Approaches to Studying Inventory (RASI) and its Use in Management Education
DO  - 10.1177/1469787404040461
PY  - 2004///
AB  - Learning styles research has been widely applied within the fields of management education and development. This article introduces an alternative concept of learning styles – approach to learning – which has scarcely impacted on the field of management learning. The development of an approach to learning instrument, the Revised Approaches to Studying Inventory (RASI) is described. I outline how approaches to learning may contribute to our understanding of teaching and learning in management education using a model of presage–process–product. Using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), some psychometric properties of the RASI are examined using samples of business and management undergraduate students. CFAs support the hypothesized structure of Tait and Entwistle (1996). Consequently, use of the RASI by management educators is encouraged. The article concludes with some ways in which the RASI may be applied to enhance the quality of learning of management students.

TI  - Operations Management: A Supply Chain Approach
PY  - 1999///
AB  - Operations Management is the effective planning, organization and control of the resources and activities needed to provide customers with goods and services. This encompasses a broad range of functions including the provision of raw materials, manufacturing, assembly and distribution of finished goods to the client. With the increasing use of subcontractors in disparate locations for many business functions and the continual drive for shorter lead-times, this supply-chain network is a critical factor in business success. Derek WallerAEs new approach to operations management treats operations and the supply chain as an integrated system, highlighting the links between the supply chain and all other parts of the business in both the manufacturing and service sectors. To reflect this, he gives more prominence to key topics such as inventory control, quality, planning and forecasting than many competitive books. A comprehensive and practical text, the first edition has been praised for its fresh approach, lively writing style, use of examples and international emphasis.The current book takes a fully student-centred approach complete with chapter introductions, summaries, boxed examples, questions, exercises and cases. As befits a modern text in operations management, Waller balances the coverage of manufacturing and service sectors and includes up-to-date technological topics.The new edition will be rewritten throughout to incorporate the latest technological advances and business thinking. In addition, the supply chain approach will be more clearly highlighted, along with links to strategy, to provide a more coherent conceptual framework.

TI  - Threshold-Based Allocation Policies for Inventory Management of Red Blood Cells
DO  - 10.1287/msom.2017.0650
PY  - 2017///
AB  - Under current regulations, red blood cell (RBC) units can be transfused to patients up to 42 days after donation. However, recent studies suggest an association between the age of transfused RBCs and adverse clinical outcomes for their recipients. Therefore, there is an interest in inventory management policies that could reduce the age of transfused RBCs without compromising their availability. In this work, we study the performance of a practical family of threshold-based allocation policies, designed to trade off the age of RBC transfusions with their availability at hospitals. To this end, we consider a stylized model of a hospital blood bank that procures its required blood from local donations. For this model, we develop a new method to exactly evaluate the performance of the threshold policy in terms of the distribution of the age of allocated units and the proportion of outdates and lost demand. Through numerical and structural results, we obtain new insights on the performance of the threshold po...

TI  - Blood Inventory Management: An Overview of Theory and Practice
DO  - 10.1287/MNSC.30.7.777
PY  - 1984///
AB  - Blood Inventory Management has attracted significant interest from the Operations Research profession during the last 15 years. A number of methodological contributions have been made in the areas of inventory theory and combinatoric optimization that can be of use to other products or systems. These contributions include the development of exact and approximate ordering and issuing policies for an inventory system, the analysis of LIFO or multi-product systems, and various forms of distribution scheduling. In addition, many of these results have been implemented, either as decision rules for efficient blood management in a hospital, or as decision support systems for hierarchical planning in a Regional Blood Center. In this paper we attempt a review of the recent Operations Research contributions to blood inventory management theory and practice. Whereas many problems have been solved, others remain open and new ones keep being created with advances in medical technology and practices. Our approach is not to present an exhaustive review of all the literature in the field, but rather to address several important issues from a unified perspective of theory and practice, and point out new areas for further research.

TI  - Timing of Product Allocation: Using Probabilistic Selling to Enhance Inventory Management
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.2014.1948
PY  - 2015///
AB  - This paper examines probabilistic selling PS as an inventory-management mechanism, paying special attention to the impact of the timing of product assignment to buyers of probabilistic goods. In practice, sellers tend to offer probabilistic products only after major demand uncertainty has been resolved. By deferring product assignments, a firm is able to obtain more information about demand for each specific product before deciding which product to assign to consumers. However, our analysis demonstrates that PS can be an effective inventory-management mechanism even if the firm allocates products before knowing which product will be more popular and, thus, scarcer. Interestingly, we show that it can be more profitable for the firm to allocate products to consumers before, rather than after, learning the true demand for a product because, although early allocation imposes higher inventory costs as a result of larger required inventory levels, it also enables the firm to charge higher prices. Our results also reveal that, when introducing probabilistic goods, the firm should order less inventory relative to the case where probabilistic goods are not offered if costs are very low but more inventory otherwise. Finally, we show that PS, as an inventory-management mechanism, can create a win--win situation, both improving profit and increasing social welfare. This paper was accepted by J. Miguel Villas-Boas, marketing.

TI  - Inventory Management Under Market Size Dynamics
DO  - 10.1287/MNSC.1080.0889
PY  - 2008///
AB  - We investigate the situation where a customer experiencing an inventory stockout at a retailer potentially leaves the firm's market. In classical inventory theory, a unit stockout penalty cost has been used as a surrogate to mimic the economic effect of such a departure; in this study, we explicitly represent this aspect of consumer behavior, incorporating the diminishing effect of the consumers leaving the market upon the stochastic demand distribution in a time-dynamic context. The initial model considers a single firm. We allow for consumer forgiveness where customers may flow back to the committed purchasing market from a nonpurchasing “latent” market. The per-period decisions include a marketing mix to attract latent and new consumers to the committed market and the setting of inventory levels. We establish conditions under which the firm optimally operates a base-stock inventory policy. The subsequent two models consider a duopoly where the potential market for a firm is now the committed market of ...

TI  - Demand Estimation from Censored Observations with Inventory Record Inaccuracy
DO  - 10.1287/msom.2015.0520
PY  - 2015///
AB  - A retailer cannot sell more than it has in stock; therefore, its sales observations are a censored representation of the underlying demand process. When a retailer forecasts demand based on past sales observations, it requires an estimation approach that accounts for this censoring. Several authors have analyzed inventory management with demand learning in environments with censored observations, but the authors assume that inventory levels are known and hence that stockouts are observed. However, firms often do not know how many units of inventory are available to meet demand, a phenomenon known as inventory record inaccuracy. We investigate the impact of this unknown on demand estimation in an environment with censored observations. When the firm does not account for inventory uncertainty when estimating demand, we discover and characterize a systematic downward bias in demand estimation under typical assumptions on the distribution of inventory record inaccuracies. We propose and test a heuristic prescription that relies on a single error statistic and that sharply reduces this bias.

DO  - 10.1177/1084713808319941
PY  - 2008///
AB  - Progressive Audiologic Tinnitus Management (PATM) is based on the premise that tinnitus is managed most efficiently using a hierarchy of clinical services that address different levels of need. PATM includes five levels of management: (a) triage; (b) audiologic evaluation; (c) group education; (d) tinnitus evaluation; and (e) individualized management. This article provides an overview of PATM and focuses on the procedures that make up the Level 2 Audiologic Evaluation. The evaluation is conducted to assess the potential need for medical, audiologic (hearing loss, tinnitus, hyperacusis), and/or mental health services. The Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, Hearing Handicap Inventory, and Tinnitus and Hearing Survey are used to differentiate effects of tinnitus and hearing loss. If indicated, patients are interviewed with the Tinnitus-Impact Screening Interview. Patients requiring amplification receive hearing aids. Often, management of hearing loss at Level 2 addresses any problems that were attributed to the tinnitus, which obviates further tinnitus-specific intervention.

PY  - 2004///
AB  - In global business competition, companies believe greater transparency in supply-chain operations and collaboration is very important for success. Transparency brings accountability and responsibility. This openness in the supply-chain allows companies to see how their suppliers are performing, from their sourcing of raw materials to their delivery to the retail outlet. Achieving greater transparency in the supply chain requires the development of comprehensive e-Logistics tools, which provide all players with open communication and shared information in every stage of the order-to-delivery process. Supply-chain transparency in ordering, inventory and transportation is a prerequisite for optimization and is critical for making business decisions. In this paper, the experiences of a virtual supply-chain (VSC) company are discussed with reference to the strategies, methods and technologies of its supply-chain. The supply-chain aims for improved customer satisfaction and hence for overall competitiveness in a global market. This discussion will be useful for other companies intending to emulate some of the critical success factors in VSC management.

DO  - 10.1007/S00170-006-0405-X
PY  - 2007///
AB  - In this paper, inventory management of time-sensitive materials using RFID data is studied using simulation. Based on the production data obtained from a manufacturing company, three inventory management models that rely on RFID data for tracking and dispatching of time-sensitive materials on a shop floor is presented. The complexity of the models ranges from statically-set, fixed baseline inventory models to dynamic, forecast-integrated inventory control schemes. This study compares the inventory models on the basis of service level, cost, inventory and waste reduction, and decision-making complexity. A comparative analysis of the models is presented in a simulation environment, which also demonstrates the overall benefits and effectiveness of RFID technologies in providing low-cost manufacturing solutions, reduced inventory levels, and lower overall waste. The forecast-integrated inventory model is developed based on a trend-adjusted exponential smoothing algorithm, with two smoothing parameters, α and β, used as coefficients for the average production demand and its trend, respectively. The study shows that the desired level of system performance can be achieved by adjusting the values of the smoothing parameters.

TI  - LQ Optimal Sliding Mode Supply Policy for Periodic Review Inventory Systems
DO  - 10.1109/TAC.2009.2036305
PY  - 2010///
AB  - In this technical note, the problem of inventory management in supply chain is addressed from a control theory perspective. In the analyzed setting, the stock used to satisfy an unknown, time-varying demand can be replenished from several supply sources. The replenishment orders are realized with delay which differs among suppliers and transport alternatives. A novel sliding-mode inventory policy is proposed, which guarantees that the demand is always entirely satisfied from the on-hand stock (yielding zero lost-sales cost), the warehouse capacity is not exceeded (what eliminates the risk of high-cost emergency storage) and ordered goods are not returned to the suppliers. As opposed to the classical, stochastic approaches, the parameters of the proposed controller are selected by minimizing a quadratic cost functional, which ensures an optimal dynamical performance of inventory systems with disparate lead times.

DO  - 10.1007/S10729-008-9066-7
PY  - 2008///
AB  - The materials management group at any hospital is responsible for ensuring that their inventory policies provide a good service in delivering products. The group also needs to be aware of their own costs for distribution, in terms of the frequency of delivery. With future changes to the hospital’s infrastructure, function and size, the group require that these policies are reviewed and prepared for the changes taking place. For this, inventory policy models need to be built and used to anticipate the effect of these changes. Due to the importance of many products, high service levels are essential, yet there are often space and delivery constraints, limiting the amount of stock which can be held and delivered at each location. We present in this paper a new constraint-based model for determining optimal stock levels for all products at a storage location, with restrictions on space, delivery and criticality of items taken into account. We validate this model on sterile and bulk items in a real-life setting of an intensive care unit within Cork University Hospital, Ireland.

AB  - I found this chapter to be very informative. The subsequent chapters present material on approximate order policies, inventory depletion management and deterministic models, including the basic EOQmodel with perishability and the dynamic deterministic model with perishability. Finally, the last chapters of the book explore decaying inventories, queues with impatient customers and blood bank inventory control. In summary, this is a very comprehensive short contribution in a specialised area of inventory control theory and management, and one that may provide a single well-referenced source of up-to-date information for anyone researching in that field. It may also be used as supplementary material in specialised quantitative Inventory Control and Inventory Management courses. Finally, practitioners and consultants can find useful insights here and well thought out methods that can be tried in practice.

PY  - 2000///
AB  - Several approaches to preventing burnout are compared. One hundred and fifty-four nurses in five Hong Kong hospitals completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), the Organizational Socialization Inventory (OSI), and three measures of personal stress management. Results indicated that favourable evaluations on the four OSI domains (job training, organizational understanding, coworker support and future prospects) yielded strong negative correlations with the burnout components. Also, the personal stress management measures had strong negative correlations with depersonalization and decreased personal accomplishment, but none were related to emotional exhaustion. Stepwise regression analyses indicated that training was the only (inverse) predictor of emotional exhaustion, whereas interpersonal skills and understanding were strong (inverse) predictors of depersonalization. Additionally, interpersonal skills and coworker support were excellent (inverse) predictors of decreased personal accomplishment. The findings are discussed in terms of their relevance to nursing administration.

TI  - Inventory Management in the Era of Big Data
DO  - 10.1111/POMS.2_12637
PY  - 2016///
AB  - The explosion in the availability and accessibility of machine-readable data is creating new opportunities for better decision making in applications of operations management. The swell of data and advances in machine learning have enabled applications that predict, for example, consumer demand for video games based on online web-search queries (Choi and Varian 2012) or box-office ticket demand based on Twitter chatter (Asur and Huberman 2010). In the context of inventory management, demand is the key uncertainty affecting decisions and such works suggest a potential opportunity to leverage large-scale web data to improve inventory decisions, for example, for stocking video game titles or allocating cinemas of varying capacities. There are also many other applications of machine learning, including Da et al. (2011), Goel et al. (2010), Gruhl et al. (2004, 2005), Kallus (2014), that use large-scale and web-based data to generate predictions of quantities that may in fact be of interest in operations management applications. By and large, however, these applications and the machine learning techniques employed do not address optimal decision-making under uncertainty that is appropriate for operations management problems and, in particular, for inventory management. We study how these data, leveraged appropriately, can correctly and successfully inform inventory management decisions and provide a competitive edge. We focus on a particular case study of the distribution and manufacturing arm of a global media conglomerate (henceforth, the vendor), which, as a distributor of multi-media, is among the three largest in the world. The vendor, which shall remain unnamed, is a direct customer of Silkroute, a provider of analytics platforms for managing manufacturing, distribution, and retail operations. The vendor, which ships an average of 1 billion units in a year, as well as the media retail industry at large, is under increased pressure to improve operations and lower costs in the face of increasing digitalization, declining sales, and diminishing shelf space. The heightened importance and consequence of good inventory decisions provide an excellent case study of the use of large-scale data for achieving a competitive edge in a squeezed industry. We consider the vendor’s VMI (vendor-manage inventory) operations in selling over half-a-million entertainment titles on CD, DVD, and BluRay at major European retailers with over 20,000 locations. To inform VMI decisions, we leverage transactional records collected and organized by the Silkroute platform, data we harvested from public Internet sources including IMDb.com (International Movie Database) and RottenTomatoes.com, and search query volume data provided by Google Trends. To leverage these data, we employ recent data-driven optimization techniques developed by Bertsimas and Kallus (2014) that address the conditional stochastic optimization problem:

DO  - 10.1080/00207543.2012.752587
PY  - 2013///
AB  - This paper proposes a logistic-based approach to a class of inventory problems with shortages and time decay functions. Time decay and shortages are a common phenomena in products with short life cycles, and financial volatility necessitates more accurate characterisation of inventory costs based on time-adjusted value. In this paper an extended approach of Wagner–Whitin (WW) is used to determine lot sizes, replenishment cycle, and schedules. A sensitivity analysis of the proposed optimisation procedure has been conducted to justify its advantages.

TI  - The impact of efficient inventory management on profitability: evidence from selected manufacturing firms in Ghana.
PY  - 2015///
AB  - Given the important contributions of the manufacturing sector to the Ghanaian economy, this research deems it necessary to evaluate the impact of efficient inventory management on the profitability of manufacturing firms in Ghana. A cross sectional data from 2004 to 2014 was gathered for the analysis from the annual reports of four manufacturing firms listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange. Measures of profitability were examined and related to proxies for efficient inventory management by manufacturers. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) stated in the form of a multiple regression model was applied in the analysis. The study revealed that the main variable raw materials inventory management designed to capture the effect of efficient management of raw material inventory by a company on it’s profitability is significantly strong and positive and impacts on the profitability of the manufacturing firms in Ghana. Therefore, efficient management of raw material inventory is a major factor to be considered by Ghanaian manufacturers in enhancing or boosting their profitability.

TI  - Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Waste Management—Assessment of Quantification Methods
DO  - 10.3155/1047-3289.61.5.480
PY  - 2011///
AB  - ABSTRACT Of the many sources of urban greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, solid waste is the only one for which management decisions are undertaken primarily by municipal governments themselves and is hence often the largest component of cities’ corporate inventories. It is essential that decision-makers select an appropriate quantification methodology and have an appreciation of methodological strengths and shortcomings. This work compares four different waste emissions quantification methods, including Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1996 guidelines, IPCC 2006 guidelines, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Waste Reduction Model (WARM), and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities- Partners for Climate Protection (FCM-PCP) quantification tool. Waste disposal data for the greater Toronto area (GTA) in 2005 are used for all methodologies; treatment options (including landfill, incineration, compost, and anaerobic digestion) are examined where available in methodologies. Landfill was shown to be the greatest source of GHG emissions, contributing more than three-quarters of total emissions associated with waste management. Results from the different landfill gas (LFG) quantification approaches ranged from an emissions source of 557 kt carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) (FCM-PCP) to a carbon sink of −53 kt CO2e (EPA WARM). Similar values were obtained between IPCC approaches. The IPCC 2006 method was found to be more appropriate for inventorying applications because it uses a waste-in-place (WIP) approach, rather than a methane commitment (MC) approach, despite perceived onerous data requirements for WIP. MC approaches were found to be useful from a planning standpoint; however, uncertainty associated with their projections of future parameter values limits their applicability for GHG inventorying. MC and WIP methods provided similar results in this case study; however, this is case specific because of similarity in assumptions of present and future landfill parameters and quantities of annual waste deposited in recent years being relatively consistent. IMPLICATIONS This paper provides insight for municipalities, consultants, and others involved in GHG quantification from waste management with regard to emissions from various treatment options and variation due to methodological selection. By examining the differences in emissions from the quantification tools and guidelines examined in this research, these professionals will gain insight on where shortcomings and methodological differences exist and how these may be addressed. It also provides an illustration of how theoretical yield gas calculations can be similar in magnitude to those calculated using a WIP approach.

TI  - Building a high-quality sense inventory for improved abbreviation disambiguation
DO  - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btq129
PY  - 2010///
AB  - Motivation: The ultimate goal of abbreviation management is to disambiguate every occurrence of an abbreviation into its expanded form (concept or sense). To collect expanded forms for abbreviations, previous studies have recognized abbreviations and their expanded forms in parenthetical expressions of bio-medical texts. However, expanded forms extracted by abbreviation recognition are mixtures of concepts/senses and their term variations. Consequently, a list of expanded forms should be structured into a sense inventory, which provides possible concepts or senses for abbreviation disambiguation. Results: A sense inventory is a key to robust management of abbreviations. Therefore, we present a supervised approach for clustering expanded forms. The experimental result reports 0.915 F1 score in clustering expanded forms. We then investigate the possibility of conflicts of protein and gene names with abbreviations. Finally, an experiment of abbreviation disambiguation on the sense inventory yielded 0.984 accuracy and 0.986 F1 score using the dataset obtained from MEDLINE abstracts. Availability: The sense inventory and disambiguator of abbreviations are accessible at http://www.nactem.ac.uk/software/acromine/ and http://www.nactem.ac.uk/software/acromine_disambiguation/ Contact: okazaki@chokkan.org

TI  - Transportation, facility location and inventory issues in distribution network design: An investigation
DO  - 10.1108/01443579810206299
PY  - 1998///
AB  - Examines the interdependence between facility location, transportation and inventory issues in a distribution network design problem. Management of inventories, determination of transportation policy, and location of plants and distribution centers are normally carried out by different groups of people in an organization. These activities interact, however, when the transportation is used to replace inventory, an increase in the number of warehouses increases total system inventory or location of warehouses would dictate the type of transportation mode choice or carrier that needs to be used. The proposed model, FLITNET, is expected to provide a more complete representation of the trade‐offs that exist among the location, transportation and inventory cost components, and lead to an optimal solution.

TI  - Role of Inventory Buffers in Construction Labor Performance
DO  - 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2005)131:7(834)
PY  - 2005///
AB  - Buffers of material stockpile (inventory) are formed at the work level in construction to help manage production. The size of material stockpiles often has an important bearing on construction project performance. In construction projects, where conditions are often uncertain and variable, some have suggested that buffers be sized and located according to the conditions. New management thinking like lean construction and theory of constraints suggests that the size of buffers needs to be managed carefully, because when oversized, buffers are wasteful, impede workflow, and hinder performance. Research has shown that project variability can be affected with the careful deployment of buffers but has not really evaluated the impact on construction labor performance. This paper reports an exploratory analysis of the relationship between inventory (buffers) and construction labor performance with data collected from three commercial projects in Brazil. In this study, the size of the buffer between rebar fabrication and installation in the construction of a structural system is compared to the labor performance of the fabrication and installation crews. The results show that some buffer helps achieve the best labor performance in the construction operations studied.

TI  - A Model for Fresh Produce Shelf-Space Allocation and Inventory Management with Freshness-Condition-Dependent Demand
DO  - 10.1287/ijoc.1070.0219
PY  - 2008///
AB  - Asignificant amount of work has investigated inventory control problems associated with fresh produce. Much of this work has considered deteriorating inventory control with many models having been proposed for various situations. However, no researchers have specifically studied fresh produce, which has its own special characteristics. Most research categorizes fresh produce into more general deteriorating categories with random lifetimes and nondecaying utilities. However, this classification is not reasonable or practical because the freshness of an item usually plays an important role in influencing the demand for the produce. In this paper, a single-period inventory and shelf-space allocation model is proposed for fresh produce. These items usually have a very short lifetime. The demand rate is assumed to be deterministic and dependent on both the displayed inventory (the number of facings of items on the shelves) and the items' freshness condition (which decreases over time). Several problem instances of different sizes are provided and solved by a modified generalized reduced gradient algorithm.

TI  - Inventory control for point-of-use locations in hospitals
DO  - 10.1057/jors.2011.52
PY  - 2012///
AB  - Most inventory management systems at hospital departments are characterised by lost sales, periodic reviews with short lead times, and limited storage capacity. We develop two types of exact models that deal with all these characteristics. In a capacity model, the service level is maximised subject to a capacity restriction, and in a service model the required capacity is minimised subject to a service level restriction. We also formulate approximation models applicable for any lost-sales inventory system (cost objective, no lead time restrictions etc). For the capacity model, we develop a simple inventory rule to set the reorder levels and order quantities. Numerical results for this inventory rule show an average deviation of 1% from the optimal service levels. We also embed the single-item models in a multi-item system. Furthermore, we compare the performance of fixed order size replenishment policies and (R, s, S) policies.

TI  - Optimal inventory policies when stockouts result from defective products
DO  - 10.1080/00207548008919699
PY  - 1980///
AB  - An implicit assumption underlying most inventory systems is that the lot ordered will not contain any defective, i.e., unsaleable items when delivered and so there will be no ‘shortages’ in the delivery in the sense that every unit of the product in the accepted lot is of perfect quality and therefore fully acceptable to the customers. Such an assumption is not always tenable in view of the extensive use of acceptance sampling by business and industry in the quality control process. The presence of defective items in the traditional inventory models which foresee no such possibility would certainly disrupt the systems in use, and consequently entail higher operating cost on the inventory management. With an aim to broaden the base of applications, and to demonstrate the impacts of the possible presence of defective products upon the structure and the cost of certain inventory systems, this paper extends two inventory models to the case where the proportion of defective units in the accepted lot is a rando...

TI  - Multistage Inventory Management with Expediting
DO  - 10.1287/opre.48.6.878.12399
PY  - 2000///
AB  - After reformulating Clark and Scarf's (1960) classical serial multi-echelon model so that the lead time between adjacent echelons is one week (period), the option to expedite between each resulting echelon is added. Thus, each week requires a decision to be made at each echelon on how many units to expedite in from the next upstream echelon (to be received immediately) and how many to regular order (to be received in one week), with the remainder detained (left as is). The model can be interpreted as addressing dynamic lead time management, in which the (remaining) effective lead time for each ordered unit can be dynamically reduced by expediting and/or extended. Use of Clark and Scarf's (1960) idea of echelon stocks reduces a complex, multidimensional stocking problem to the analysis of a series of one-dimensional subproblems. What are calledtop-down base stock policies, which are readily amenable to managerial interpretation, are shown to be optimal. Myopic policies are shown to be optimal in the stationary, in1nite horizon case. The results are illustrated numerically.

TI  - A Bayesian Inventory Model Using Real-Time Condition Monitoring Information
DO  - 10.1111/J.1937-5956.2010.01200.X
PY  - 2011///
AB  - Lack of coordination between machinery fault diagnosis and inventory management for spare parts can lead to increased inventory costs and disruptions in production activity. We develop a framework for incorporating real-time condition monitoring information into inventory decisions for spare parts. We consider a manufacturer who periodically replenishes inventory for a machine part that is subject to deterioration. The deterioration is captured via condition monitoring and modeled using a Wiener process. The resulting degradation model is used to derive the life distribution of a functioning part and to estimate the demand distribution for spare parts. This estimation is periodically updated, in a Bayesian manner, as additional information on part deterioration is obtained. We develop an inventory model that incorporates this updated demand distribution and demonstrate that a dynamic base-stock policy, in which the optimal base-stock level is a function of some subset of the observed condition monitoring information, is optimal. We propose a myopic critical fractile policy that captures the essence of the optimal policy, but is easier to compute. Computational experiments indicate that this heuristic performs quite well relative to the optimal policy. Adaptive inventory policies such as these can help manufacturers to increase machine availability and reduce inventory costs.

TI  - Greek Brief Pain Inventory: Validation and Utility in Cancer Pain
DO  - 10.1159/000055294
PY  - 2000///
AB  - Objective: The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a pain assessment tool. It has been translated into and validated in several languages. The purpose of this study was the translation into and validation of the BPI in Greek. Moreover, we wanted to detect cultural and social differences, if any, of pain interference in patients’ lives. Methods: The translation and validation of the inventory took place at the Areteion Hospital. The final validation sample consisted of 220 cancer patients (123 males, 97 females, age range 21–87 years, mean age 61.3). Primary cancer locations were lung 25.6%, gastrointestinal tract 25.6%, breast 11.5%, prostate 7.07%, gynecological cancers 9.6% and others 20.57%. The patients themselves completed the majority of the Greek BPI (G-BPI) papers. The pain management index (PMI) was also calculated in order to assess the adequacy of pain treatment. Assessing the reliability and the validity made the actual validation of the G-BPI. Results: Pain severity and pain management: 147 patients reported severe pain, 48 patients moderate, and 25 patients mild pain (mean average pain 6.22). From these patients only 21 were found on strong and 33 on weak opioid treatment, while 166 patients were found on no opioid analgesic treatment. In agreement with these data is the PMI which was positive only for 9 patients, while 44 patients had PMI = 0 and all the others had negative PMI scores. Reliability and Validity of the G-BPI: Coefficient alphas were 0.849 for the interference items and 0.887 for the severity items. Additionally, the factor analysis of the G-BPI items results in a two-factor solution, that satisfies the criteria of reproducibility, interpretability and confirmatory setting. Conclusion: This study shows the efficacy of the G-BPI for the assessment of pain severity as well as the pain management in Greece, and therefore its utility in improving the analgesic treatment outcome in Greek patients.

TI  - Simulation-based optimization for a capacitated multi-echelon production-inventory system
DO  - 10.1057/jos.2015.5
PY  - 2015///
AB  - One of the most important aspects affecting the performance of a supply chain is the management of inventories. Managing inventory in complex supply chains is typically difficult, and may have a significant impact on the customer service level and system-wide costs. The main challenge of inventory management is that almost every inventory problem involves multiple and conflicting objectives that need to be optimized simultaneously. In this paper, we present an efficient way using simulation-based optimization approach to determine the optimal inventory control parameters of a multi-echelon production-inventory system under a stochastic environment. The Pareto dominance concept is implemented to find a set of near optimal solutions for determining the best trade-off between objectives. The Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is used to determine the appropriate inventory control parameters to minimize the total inventory cost and maximize the service level. To evaluate the control parameters generated by the MOPSO, an object-oriented framework for developing the simulation model is presented. Finally, we provide a real-world case study of a major food product supply chain to demonstrate the use of proposed approach and enable decision making at inventory management. The proposed algorithm is compared with existing multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II).

DO  - 10.1007/s10342-006-0161-3
PY  - 2007///
AB  - The role of European forests and forest management in the carbon balance has received much attention in research recently. This was particularly motivated by the recognition of forest management as one possible measure countries may adopt in the framework of the Kyoto Protocol to reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere. The main method to assess carbon budget in forests is based on traditional forest inventories. This method requires the conversion of measured stem volume to carbon pools. This conversion has been identified as a large source of uncertainty in past assessments. Over the last 5 years, intensive research efforts have resulted in significant advances in the reliability of forest inventory based carbon budgets. In parallel, the impact of forest management on the carbon balance of forest ecosystems has been investigated and the carbon mitigation potential of these activities has been analysed. This paper reviews the progress that was made in these two fields of research with a particular focus on European forests.

This study considers the question of whether there is empirical evidence to suggest that firms do adjust their financial ratios to such targets. The results of the test, using the partial adjustment model, indicate that financial ratios are periodically adjusted to their industry means. One way management can adjust the financial ratios to predetermined targets is to choose from the set of generally accepted accounting measurement rules (e.g., inventory valuation methods) those which affect the financial ratios in the desired direction. This technique-in the context of the income smoothing hypothesis-was proposed by Gordon as a means of maximizing management's utility:

TI  - Multi-echelon inventory management in supply chains with uncertain demand and lead times: Literature review from an operational research perspective
DO  - 10.1243/09544054JEM889
PY  - 2007///
AB  - Abstract Historically, the echelons of the supply chain, warehouse, distributors, retailers, etc., have been managed independently, buffered by large inventories. Increasing competitive pressures and market globalization are forcing firms to develop supply chains that can quickly respond to customer needs. To remain competitive and decrease inventory, these firms must use multi-echelon inventory management interactively, while reducing operating costs and improving customer service. The current paper reviews the literature, addressing multiechelon inventory management in supply chains from 1996 to 2005. The behaviour of the papers against demand and lead-time uncertainty is the key analysis point of the literature review presented here and it is conducted from an operational research point of view. Finally, directions for future research are suggested.

TI  - The Impact of Modeling on Robust Inventory Management Under Demand Uncertainty
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.2015.2183
PY  - 2016///
AB  - This study considers a basic inventory management problem with nonzero fixed order costs under interval demand uncertainty. The existing robust formulations obtained by applying well-known robust optimization methodologies become computationally intractable for large problem instances due to the presence of binary variables. This study resolves this intractability issue by proposing a new robust formulation that is shown to be solvable in polynomial time when the initial inventory is zero or negative. Because of the computational efficiency of the new robust formulation, it is implemented on a folding-horizon basis, leading to a new heuristic for the problem. The computational results reveal that the new heuristic is not only superior to the other formulations regarding the computing time needed, but also outperforms the existing robust formulations in terms of the actual cost savings on the larger instances. They also show that the actual cost savings yielded by the new heuristic are close to a lower bou...

DO  - 10.1108/09600030110387480
PY  - 2001///
AB  - Effective inventory management is critical to retailing success. Surprisingly, there is little published empirical research examining relationships between retail inventory, sales and customer service. Based on a survey of 101 chain store units, this paper develops and tests a series of hypotheses about retail inventory. Seventy‐five percent of the store owners/managers responded to the mail survey. As expected, significant positive relationships were found between inventory, service and sales. Specifically, support was found for the theory that inventory is a function of the square root of sales. Also, greater product variety leads to higher inventory, and service level is an exponential function of inventory. Finally, demand uncertainty was found to have no apparent effect on inventory levels.

TI  - Extended-Enterprise Supply-Chain Management at IBM Personal Systems Group and Other Divisions
DO  - 10.1287/inte.30.1.7.11616
PY  - 2000///
AB  - In 1994, IBM began to reengineer its global supply chain. It wanted to achieve quick responsiveness to customers with minimal inventory. To support this effort, we developed an extended-enterprise supply-chain analysis tool, the Asset Management Tool (AMT). AMT integrates graphical process modeling, analytical performance optimization, simulation, activity-based costing, and enterprise database connectivity into a system that allows quantitative analysis of extended supply chains. IBM has used AMT to study such issues as inventory budgets, turnover objectives, customer-service targets, and new-product introductions. We have implemented it at a number of IBM business units and their channel partners. AMT benefits include over $750 million in material costs and price-protection expenses saved in 1998.

PY  - 2011///
AB  - This article studies the within-model-year pricing, production, and inventory management of new automobiles. Using new monthly data on U.S. transaction prices, we document that, for the typical vehicle, prices fall over the model year at a 9.0% annual rate. Concurrently, both sales and inventories are hump shaped. To explain these time series, we formulate an industry model for new automobiles in which inventory and pricing decisions are made simultaneously. The model predicts that automakers' build-to-stock inventory management policy substantially influences the time series of prices and sales, accounting for four tenths of the price decline observed over the model year.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF FOREST PARAMETERS BY MEANS OF LASER SCANNING
PY  - 2002///
AB  - This paper deals with forest inventory methods based on laser scanning and satellite remote sensing. It will be demonstrated to what extent forest inventories can benefit from the synergistic use of both sensor types. The forest inventory parameters to be assessed are: tree height, timber volume, tree species, tree age, stand boundary, and basal area. The results presented are derived from the “HIGHSCAN” project (Assessing forest stand attributes by integrated use of high-resolution satellite imagery and laser scanner) which is coordinated by the Helsinki University of Technology and financed by the EU, DG XII. Developments have been carried out in close co-operation with forest management authorities, in particular with private forest owners. In this paper the results derived from the Austrian test sites will be presented.

DO  - 10.1002/NAV.1026
PY  - 2001///
AB  - Allocation of scarce common components to finished product orders is central to the performance of assembly systems. Analysis of these systems is complex, however, when the product master schedule is subject to uncertainty. In this paper, we analyze the cost—service performance of a component inventory system with correlated finished product demands, where component allocation is based on a fair shares method. Such issuing policies are used commonly in practice. We quantify the impact of component stocking policies on finished product delays due to component shortages and on product order completion rates. These results are used to determine optimal base stock levels for components, subject to constraints on finished product service (order completion rates). Our methodology can help managers of assembly systems to (1) understand the impact of their inventory management decisions on customer service, (2) achieve cost reductions by optimizing their inventory investments, and (3) evaluate supplier performance and negotiate contracts by quantifying the effect of delivery lead times on costs and customer service. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

DO  - 10.1108/IJPDLM-09-2013-0240
PY  - 2014///
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the effect of inventory record inaccuracy due to behavioral aspects of workers on the order and inventory variance amplification. Design/methodology/approach – The authors adopt a continuous-time analytical approach to describe the effect of inbound throughput on the inventory and order variance amplification due to the workload pressure and arousal of workers. The model is numerically solved through simulation and results are analyzed with statistical general linear model. Findings – Inventory management policies that usually dampen variance amplification are not effective when inaccuracy is generated due to workers’ behavioral aspects. Specifically, the psychological sensitivity and stability of workers to deal with a given range of operational conditions have a combined and multiplying effect over the amplification of order and inventory variance generated by her/his errors. Research limitations/implications – The main limitation of the research is that...

TI  - Tracking the Source of the Decline in GDP Volatility: An Analysis of the Automobile Industry
DO  - 10.2139/ssrn.724921
PY  - 2005///
AB  - Recent papers by Kim and Nelson (1999) and McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000) uncover a dramatic decline in the volatility of U.S. GDP growth beginning in 1984. Determining whether the source is good luck, good policy or better inventory management has since developed into an active area of research. This paper seeks to shed light on the source of the decline in volatility by studying the behavior of the U.S. automobile industry, where the changes in volatility have mirrored those of the aggregate data. We find that changes in the relative volatility of sales and output, which have been interpreted by some as evidence of improved inventory management, could in fact be the result of changes in the process driving automobile sales. We first show that the autocorrelation of sales dropped during the 1980s, and that the behavior of interest rates may be the force behind the change in sales persistence. A simulation of the assembly plants' cost function illustrates that the persistence of sales is a key determinant of output volatility. A comparison of the ways in which assembly plants scheduled production in the 1990s relative to the 1970s supports the intuition of the simulation.

PY  - 1999///
AB  - We consider a facility that provides service to customers using items of inventory. Assuming instantaneous order replenishments, we show that under both the expected discounted cost and the average cost per unit time criteria, the optimal policy is patient, that is, never to order when the system is empty, to place an order only when the inventory level drops to zero, and a threshold ordering policy is optimal. We also model the case where the queueing capacity is finite and the arriving customers who finds that the queue is full are rejected with penalties. Provided that the delay of serving a customer is always less costly than the cost of a rejected customer, we show that the optimal policy has the same properties as the infinite queueing system. We also present a simple heuristic policy for the problem and provide computational results

TI  - Stochastic Humanitarian Inventory Control Model for Disaster Planning
DO  - 10.3141/2022-08
PY  - 2007///
AB  - The impacts of disasters have recently attracted increased attention from researchers and policy makers. However, there has been little consensus about how an efficient inventory management model can be developed for postdisaster conditions. Victims of a disaster are generally gathered into shelters during and after a severe disaster to ensure their security. Many evacuees do not have the financial resources to leave the disaster area or to find food, drugs, and other necessities. Hence, their vital needs should be supplied efficiently throughout the disaster and postdisaster periods. Without an adequate stock of goods, satisfying the daily requirements of the victims without disruption might be problematic. To solve this problem, humanitarian inventory control models that can aid in adequately responding to a disaster or a humanitarian crisis are needed. In this context, response represents preparedness, planning, assessment, appeal, mobilization, procurement, transportation, warehousing, and distribution. This paper is concerned with the development of a subproblem of the general humanitarian supply chain problem: an efficient and quick-response humanitarian inventory management model able to determine the safety stock that will prevent disruptions at a minimal cost. The humanitarian inventory management problem is first mathematically formulated as a version of the Hungarian Inventory Control Model. A solution to this time-dependent stochastic model is then proposed by using the p-level efficient points algorithm. The single commodity case results are given, and a sensitivity analysis of the model vis-à-vis various model parameters that affect safe inventory levels is conducted.

DO  - 10.1002/AQC.846
PY  - 2007///
AB  - 1. Wetland inventory, assessment and monitoring are widely recognized as essential tools for a range of purposes that underpin sound decision-making and the management of wetlands so as to maintain their ecological character, including the critical services they provide to people worldwide. 2. In recognition of this, the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands has adopted a suite of tools designed for: (i) describing the ecological character of wetlands; (ii) assessing the pressures and associated risks of adverse change; and (iii) monitoring the extent of any change that occurs as a consequence of management actions. 3. As a prelude to considering the application of Earth Observation techniques to wetlands a review of the needs and purposes of inventory, assessment and monitoring is provided and linked with the wetlands ‘toolkit’ that the Convention has developed. In particular the usefulness of Earth Observation for undertaking such work more widely, and making its results more accessible to users, is considered. 4. As the wide typological, geographical and temporal variability of wetlands poses major challenges for inventory and assessment there have been many calls for the effective application of Earth Observation. In response a number of remote-sensing techniques have been developed or are being considered, such as the application of satellite-based radar, with more recent attention given to the application of long-wavelength (L-band) synthetic aperture radar.

PY  - 2015///
AB  - The main objective of the study was to investigate the role of inventory management on the competitive advantage of manufacturing firms in Kenya, with reference to Unga Group Limited. Specifically, the study assessed the extent to which information technology is used in inventory management in Unga Group Limited, determine how inventory lead time, inventory control and inventory control practices affect competitive advantage of Unga group limited. The study adopted a descriptive research design to support and meet the research objectives. The target population was all the 289 employees working at Unga Group Limited headquarters who directly deal with inventory management. Stratified sampling and simple random sampling techniques were employed in the selection of 30 respondents. The study used both primary and secondary data. Primary data was collected using self-administered questionnaires consisting of closed ended and open-ended questions. The data collected was analyzed by descriptive statistics using a statistical package for analysis (SPSS). The study revealed that information technology, inventory control systems, inventory lead time and inventory control practices are important factors in attainment of competitive advantage of manufacturing firms in Kenya. The study recommended that the firm should embrace inventory control systems and information technology so as to improve and enhance competitive advantage. This study also recommended a similar research on other industries to ascertain whether the findings of the study are universal.

TI  - The effectiveness of RFID in backroom and sales floor inventory management
DO  - 10.1108/IJLM-03-2015-0051
PY  - 2016///
AB  - Purpose Perceived as an antidote to poor execution, interest in radio frequency identification (RFID)-enabled visibility has grown. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether and how RFID-enabled visibility with item-level tagging improves store execution. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted three field-based experiments in collaboration with two Fortune 500 retailers. Findings RFID-enabled visibility resulted in a sizable decrease in inventory record inaccuracy and out-of-stocks for inventory held in both the backroom and on the sales floor. The decrease in inventory record inaccuracy and out-of-stocks was even greater among products stored primarily on the sales floor suggesting the benefits from increased visibility accrue to sales floor inventory management processes. In contrast, the authors found no significant improvement in inventory record inaccuracy and no substantive improvement in out-of-stocks among products stored primarily in the backroom suggesting that increased visibility does not improve backroom management processes. Practical implications The authors recommend retailers focus on sales floor inventory management when seeking to improve store execution through the adoption of RFID-enabled visibility. In the context, only partial evidence exists that backroom inventory management improves with RFID-enabled visibility. Originality/value Retailers seeking to invest in RFID technology must estimate potential performance improvements before making firm-specific cost-benefit analyses. They must also understand where and how these performance improvements will accrue. This research uniquely presents the results of a three field experiments that quantify the changes in retail execution associated with RFID adoption.

TI  - Implementation of a System Approach for Enhanced Supply Chain Continuity and Resiliency: A Longitudinal Study†
DO  - 10.1111/JBL.12021
PY  - 2013///
AB  - Researchers and practitioners frequently point to inventory as a necessary component of an effective supply chain strategy. However, an undisciplined or ineffective approach to inventory can have a detrimental impact on an organization and its entire supply chain. When making inventory decisions, firms must ensure that the selected approach “fits” the overall supply chain strategy. While such an assertion seems intuitive, there is a need for empirical validation. We seek to contribute to this important body of research by investigating the impact of improved strategic alignment of inventory on resiliency and continuity. More specifically, we investigate the impact of improved strategic fit by comparing two distinct approaches to inventory management within a service parts environment. We hypothesize that a well-aligned approach to inventory management can enhance continuity and resiliency. We test these hypotheses via a longitudinal field study involving 10 United States Air Force (USAF) locations and two years of data (approximately 650,000 inventory transactions). Results from nine test locations and one control location suggest that a well-aligned approach to inventory management is indeed effective in improving continuity and resiliency, thus enhancing service-based strategies—in this case, the USAF's ability to be mission-capable. While the results of the study are derived from the USAF, we believe the implications provide broader insight into the use of inventory as a means of realizing a strategic fit.

AB  - Information sharing is an important component of cooperation in supply chain management. This paper presents a study to evaluate the impact of information sharing on inventory and expected cost in a two-level supply chain with multiple retailers. Three levels of information sharing are given and the optimal inventory policy under each level is derived. We show that both the inventory level and expected cost of the manufacturer decrease with an increase in the level of information sharing.

TI  - VENDOR-OWNED INVENTORY MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS IN RETAIL: AN AGENCY THEORY PERSPECTIVE
DO  - 10.1002/J.2158-1592.2007.TB00234.X
PY  - 2007///
AB  - This paper undertakes two related tasks to augment current understanding regarding vendor-owned inventory management (VOIM) arrangements implemented in the retail industry. The first task formally juxtaposes three prevalent forms of VOIM arrangements (i.e., Consignment, Pay-On-Scan, and Scan-Based Trading) to one another and identifies three dimensions (i.e., Relevant Data Visibility, Timeliness of Information Release, and Shrink Responsibility) that serve to discriminate among them. The second task applies an Agency Theory lens to uncover differing profiles of characteristics underlying the retailer-vendor relationship across the Consignment, Pay-On-Scan, and Scan-Based Trading arrangements. These conceptual results contribute to and have implications for the science and practice of VOIM arrangements in the retail industry.

TI  - Use of uncertain inventory data in forestry scenario models and consequential incorrect harvest decisions.
DO  - 10.14214/SF.633
PY  - 2000///
AB  - Uncertainty in long-term timber production analyses usually focus success of regeneration, growth/mortality of trees and future fluctuations of timber prices/harvest costs, while uncertainty related to inventory data is paid less attention. At the same time, evaluations of inventory methods usually stop when the error level is stated, while the uncertainty accompanied by using the data is seldom considered. The present work addresses uncertain inventory data in long-term timber production analyses. Final harvest decisions, i.e. possible outcome intervals with respect to timing and expected net present value-losses due to incorrect timing, were considered. A case study was presented where inventory data errors according to different error levels were generated randomly. The selected error levels were based on observations from practical forest inventories in Norway. The analysis tool was GAYA-JLP. The impact of errors on decisions was derived through repeated computations of management strategies maximising net present value without harvest path constraints. A real rate of discount of 3 % and an error level of 15 % resulted in expected net present value-losses of 1 NOK ha–1 for basal area, 63 NOK ha–1 for mean height, 210 NOK ha–1 for site quality, 240 NOK ha–1 for stand age, and 499 NOK ha–1 when random errors occurred simultaneously for all these variables. The expected net present valuelosses varied considerably. The largest losses appeared for stands with ages around optimal economical rotation ages. The losses were also relatively large for young stands, while they were relatively low for overmature stands. The experiences from the case study along with considerations related to other sources of uncertainty may help us to get a more realistic attitude to the reliability of long-term timber production analyses. The results of the study may also serve as a starting point in a decision oriented inventory planning concept, in which alternatives for inventory design and intensity are based on considerations with respect to inventory costs as well as net present value-losses.

TI  - A Risk‐Based Approach to Setting Priorities in Protecting Bridges Against Terrorist Attacks
DO  - 10.1111/j.0272-4332.2004.00500.x
PY  - 2004///
AB  - This article presents an approach to the problem of terrorism risk assessment and management by adapting the framework of the risk filtering, ranking, and management method. The assessment is conducted at two levels: (1) the system level, and (2) the asset‐specific level. The system‐level risk assessment attempts to identify and prioritize critical infrastructures from an inventory of system assets. The definition of critical infrastructures offered by Presidential Decision Directive 63 was used to determine the set of attributes to identify critical assets—categorized according to national, regional, and local impact. An example application is demonstrated using information from the Federal Highway Administration National Bridge Inventory for the State of Virginia. Conversely, the asset‐specific risk assessment performs an in‐depth analysis of the threats and vulnerabilities of a specific critical infrastructure. An illustration is presented to offer some insights in risk scenario identification and prioritization, multiobjective evaluation of management options, and extreme‐event analysis for critical infrastructure protection.

TI  - A literature review on models of inventory management under uncertainty
DO  - 10.13165/VSE-15-5-1-03
PY  - 2015///
AB  - Inventories are raw materials, work-in-process goods and completely finished goods that are considered to be the portion of business’s assets that are ready or will be ready for sale. Formulating a suitable inventory model is one of the major concerns for an industry. The earliest scientific inventory management researches date back to the second decade of the past century, but the interest in this scientific area is still great. Again considering the reliability of any process is an important feature in the research activities. Values of some factors are very hard to define or almost unreal. In such cases, fuzzy models of inventory management take an important place. This paper analyzes possible parameters of existing models of inventory control. An attempt is made to provide an up-to-date review of existing literature, concentrating on descriptions of the characteristics and types of inventory control models that have been developed.

TI  - Inventory management for dual sales channels with inventory-level-dependent demand
DO  - 10.1057/jors.2014.15
PY  - 2015///
AB  - This paper studies the inventory management problem of dual channels operated by one vendor. Demands of dual channels are inventory-level-dependent. We propose a multi-period stochastic dynamic programming model which shows that under mild conditions, the myopic inventory policy is optimal for the infinite horizon problem. To investigate the importance of capturing demand dependency on inventory levels, we consider a heuristic where the vendor ignores demand dependency on inventory levels, and compare the optimal inventory levels with those recommended by the heuristic. Through numerical examples, we show that the vendor may order less for dual channels than those recommended by the heuristic, and the difference between the inventory levels in the two cases can be so large that the demand dependency on inventory levels cannot be neglected. In the end, we numerically examine the impact of different ways to treat unmet demand and obtain some managerial insights.

TI  - Inventory and Working Capital Management: An Empirical Analysis
PY  - 2008///
AB  - The working capital management refers to the management of working capital, or precisely to the management of current assets. A firm’s working capital consists of its investments in current assets, which includes short-term assets—cash and bank balance, inventories, receivable and marketable securities. Therefore, the working capital management refers to the management of the levels of all these individual current assets. On the other hand, inventory, which is one of the important elements of current assets, reflects the investment of a firm’s fund. Hence, it is necessary to efficiently manage inventories in order to avoid unnecessary investments. A firm, which neglects the management of inventories, will have to face serious problems relating to long-term profitability and may fail to survive. With the help of better inventory management, a firm can reduce the levels of inventories to a considerable degree e.g., 10 to 20% without any adverse effect on production and sales. Thus, inventory is a vital factor in business operations. This paper tries to evaluate the effect of the size of inventory and the impact on working capital through inventory ratios, working capital ratios, trends, computation of inventory and working capital, and liquidity ranking. Finally, it was found that the size of inventory directly affects working capital and it's management. Size of the inventory and working capital of Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative Limited (IFFCO) is properly managed and controlled compared to National Fertilizer Ltd. (NFL).

PY  - 2000///
AB  - A measure was developed to assess supervisor-perceived countertransference (CT) behavior during counseling sessions. Eleven experts provided face validity for the items, indicating that each item was at least somewhat an expression of countertransference. Exploratory factor analysis of ratings of 126 supervisors of supervisee counseling sessions revealed, as expected, the existence of two factors. However, rather than reflecting the dimensions of overinvolvement and underinvolvement as hypothesized, the factors were better captured by the terms Negative Countertransference and Positive Countertransference. The total scale and each subscale demonstrated high internal consistency. In addition, both positive and negative CT were found to relate positively with an existing one-item index of countertransference behavior and negatively with an existing measure of countertransference management ability. Research and clinical implications are discussed.

TI  - Inventory Management in Mass Customization Operations: A Review
DO  - 10.1109/TEM.2018.2839616
PY  - 2019///
AB  - Mass customization (MC), as an operations program to satisfy target consumers by offering personalized products or services, has attracted substantial attention from both the industry and academia. Under this program, one of the most important issues is an efficient management of the related inventories, including the work-in-process inventories, standard items, and the customized items, which can ultimately contribute to a profitable business for the companies who have launched MC. This paper, therefore, focuses on reviewing the mass customization based literature and identifying various methods to effectively manage inventory for MC schemes. In addition to regular inventory management, with the increasing emphasis on corporate social responsibility, MC companies are required to devote more effort to the proper management of leftover and returned inventories under MC. This paper, hence, examines MC inventory management in both forward and reverse logistics. Findings from this review provide a guideline to operations managers on inventory management improvement in their MC operations. Future research opportunities related to MC inventory management, such as supply chain coordination and risk management, are discussed.

TI  - Rapid manufacturing and its impact on supply chain management
PY  - 2004///
AB  - Suppliers of spare parts suffer from high inventory and distribution costs in many industries. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) have attempted to reduce these supply chain costs by cutting production lead-times, batch constraints and delivery lead-times. The emphasis in supply chain management has been towards increased inventory turnover. Today, rapid manufacturing technologies – the ability to produce parts on demand without the need for tooling and setup – has the potential to become the basis for new solutions in supply chain management. This paper presents new supply chain solutions made possible by both the centralised and decentralised applications of rapid manufacturing. A decision-support model is outlined to help supply chain managers better capture emergent business opportunities arising from rapid manufacturing technology. The logistical problems of the spare parts business in the aircraft industry are used as an example due to the high technical and logistical requirements involved. The applications and benefits of rapid manufacturing technologies in the supply chain for aircraft spare parts are presented.

TI  - An approach to estimate carbon stocks change in forest carbon pools under the UNFCCC: the Italian case
DO  - 10.3832/IFOR0457-0010086
PY  - 2008///
AB  - Abstract: Under the UNFCCC, Annex I Parties must report annually a National GHG Inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks. LULUCF is one of the six sectors of the inventory: in this sector any emissions and removals of GHGs by land management should be reported, included the large GHGs fluxes generated by forest management and land-use changes into and from forest. In this context every Party has to produce a proper model in order to be able to fulfil GHGs Inventory request for forest sector. Taking Italy as a study case, the paper aims at presenting a new methodology for updating stock changes for years between national forest inventories, in order to reproduce annual stock changes in the five UNFCCC forest carbon pools, following the UNFCCC requirements in the context of carbon reporting.

TI  - The forest management planning package: theory and application
PY  - 1993///
AB  - The Forest Management Planning Package represents a general fundamental structure of a forest management planning system based on two inventory phases. It is an existing calculation system used in practical forestry in Sweden. The Forest Management Planning Package integrates economic theory, objective inventory measurements and accurate growth forecasts. The core of the system is a chain of models depicting the production possibilities of a forest holding. Detailed growth forecasts and economic calculations with high resolution (individual trees) permit analysis of various silvicultural treatment options in all types of Swedish stands. A non-linear objective function and mathematical optimization result in a compromise between maximum net present value and sustained net-revenue profile. Application of the system contributes to a much improved economic result through the removal of uncertainties concerning the real production possibilities and it has significantly altered the management strategies of the forest companies that have implemented it.

TI  - Chaos Theory: Implications for Supply Chain Management
DO  - 10.1108/09574099810805735
PY  - 1998///
AB  - Since the late 1950's it has been recognized that the systems used internally within supply chains can lead to oscillations in demand and inventory as orders pass through the system. The uncertainty generated can result in late deliveries, order cancellations and an increased reliance on inventory to buffer these effects. Despite the best efforts of organizations to stabilize the dynamics generated, industry still experiences a high degree of uncertainty. The failure to significantly reduce uncertainty through traditional approaches may in part be explained by chaos theory. This paper defines deterministic chaos and demonstrates that supply chains can display some of the key characteristics of chaotic systems, namely: chaos exhibits sensitivity to initial conditions; it has Islands of Stability; generates patterns; invalidates the reductionist view; and, undermines computer accuracy. The implications for the management and design of supply chains are discussed.

AB  - Forest inventory procedures are likely to change or evolve at a more rapid rate over the next 15 years. Changes will be brought by changing forest management practices and priorities, increasing importance of environmental and multiple use issues, new technologies, increasing participation of industry, new market forces, and budgetary considerations.Map production is a major and costly component of forest inventory and one which will be much affected by these changes. This paper focuses on the map production component of forest inventory in Canada, but places it in the context of overall management inventory production. Inventory mapping procedures from provincial inventory cycles are summarized. The costs, time, and resources expended on each component of map production (photo acquisition, interpretation, transfer and drafting, and digitizing) are outlined. They are summarized in the context of the cost and resources needed for the total inventory process including volume sampling. Recent innovations, fo...

PY  - 2011///
AB  - In Finland, a new ALS based stand level management inventory was developed during last few years. The system is based on area based approach of ALS data. Additionally, the spectral and texture features of the aerial images are utilized in order to improve the separation of the tree species. The species-specific stand attributes are simultaneously estimated with a nearest neighbour imputation. The new airborne laser scanning based stand level management inventory system has been successful. During just a few years almost all actors of practical forestry have modified their inventory and planning systems to be compatible with the new inventory procedure which will cover almost 3 000 000 hectares in 2011. This paper describes the background, development and practical application of this inventory system.

TI  - Inventory Optimization at Procter & Gamble: Achieving Real Benefits Through User Adoption of Inventory Tools
DO  - 10.1287/inte.1100.0546
PY  - 2011///
AB  - Over the past 10 years, Procter & Gamble has leveraged its cross-functional organizational structure with operations research to reduce its inventory investment. Savings were achieved in a two-step process. First, spreadsheet-based inventory models locally optimized each stage in the supply chain. Because these were the first inventory tools installed, they achieved significant savings and established P&G's scientific inventory practices. Second, P&G's more complex supply chains implemented multiechelon inventory optimization software to minimize inventory costs across the end-to-end supply chain. In 2009, a tightly coordinated planner-led effort, supported by these tools, drove $1.5 billion in cash savings. Although case studies show the mathematics employed, of equal importance is the presentation of the planning process that facilitates inventory management and the decision tree that matches a business to the optimal inventory tool depending on the requirements of the business. Today, more than 90 percent of P&G's business units (about $70 billion in revenues) use either single-stage (70 percent) or multiechelon (30 percent) inventory management tools. Plans are underway to increase the use of multiechelon tools to manage 65 percent of P&G's supply chains in the next three years.

We use benchmarking metrics obtained from operations management literature to demonstrate an inverted-U relationship between abnormal inventory growth and one-year-ahead earnings per share for retailers. We also find that equity analysts do not fully incorporate the information contained in retailers' abnormal inventory growth in their earnings forecasts, resulting in systematic biases. Finally, we show that an investment strategy based on abnormal inventory growth yields significant abnormal stock market returns.

A dynamic multi-product, multi-facility production and inventory model. Technical Report 1, Program in Operations Research, Stanford University, Stanford, California, April 29.] inventory costs is analyzed. An essential feature of the model is that it permits backlogging of unsatisfied demand; otherwise the model is similar to the one considered by Manne [Manne, A. S. 1958. Programming of economic lot sizes. Management Sci.42, Jan. 115--135.], Wagner and Whitin [Wagner, H. M., T. M. Whitin. 1959. Dynamic version of the economic lot size model.

Unpublished notes. Stanford University, Stanford, California.]. By permitting backlogging, which mathematically means that inventories can be negative, the concavity assumptions of these authors are no longer appropriate. Instead we consider piecewise concave cost functions to find the form of the minimum cost production schedule. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm to calculate the minimum cost schedule is also presented.

PY  - 2010///
AB  - Abstract Inventory constitutes the most significant part of current assets of larger majority of Nigerian manufacturing industries. Because of the relative largeness of inventories maintained by most firms, a considerable sum of an organization’s fund is being committed to them. It thus becomes absolutely imperative to manage inventories efficiently so as to avoid the costs of changing production rates, overtime, sub-contracting, unnecessary cost of sales and back order penalties during periods of peak demand. The main objective of this study is to determine whether or not inventories in the Nigeria Bottling Company, Ilorin Plant can be evaluated and understood using the various existing tools of optimization in inventory management. The study methods employed include the variance analysis, Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Model and the Chi-square method. The answer to the fundamental question of how best an organization which handles inventory can be efficiently run is provided for in the analysis and findings of the study. Consequently, recommendations on the right quantity, quality and timing of material, at the most favourable price conclude the research study.

TI  - The JIT materials management system in developing countries
DO  - 10.1080/01446190500041388
PY  - 2005///
AB  - The just‐in‐time (JIT) approach to materials management appears to be superior to a just‐in‐case (JIC) approach in terms of reducing cost and improving productivity under most circumstances encountered in industrialized countries. However, is it truly more advantageous than the more commonly used approaches in developing countries? Contractors in developing countries may be compelled to keep excessive inventory under some circumstances to help manage uncertainty in the supply chain and production process, high inflation rates, available discounts on prices of large amounts of materials, and price cuts in case of early purchasing. This study presents a comparison of the JIT and JIC materials management systems in terms of total cost of inventory by means of a simulation model that makes use of actual data obtained from an ongoing trade centre project in Istanbul, Turkey. The study suggests that had the JIT system been used in the project in Istanbul the total cost of inventory would have been 4.4% higher than the total cost of inventory in the JIC system currently used.

TI  - Reactive Scheduling Framework for a Multiproduct Pipeline with Inventory Management
DO  - 10.1021/IE070214Q
PY  - 2007///
AB  - Real world scenarios on the planning and scheduling of the complex oil supply chain represent challenging problems. However, there is a growing need to establish decision support tools capable of dealing with competition within this industry so as to replace simple procedures, such as spreadsheets, with more efficient tools. This work studies a medium term scheduling problem of a pipeline and associated end-of-pipe tank farm. The mixed integer linear problem (MILP) formulation proposed by Relvas et al. [Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2006, 45, 7841−7855] is improved. This model represents the articulation between the pipeline schedule and the inventory management at the tank farm. The improvements include variable flowrate, pipeline stoppages, and variable settling period with product. On this scheduling model, a novel rescheduling methodology is developed, taking into account the variability of real plant changes with the definition of revisions of schedules in an effective way. The model and respective rescheduli...

TI  - Dynamic Pricing and Inventory Management Under Inventory-Dependent Demand
DO  - 10.1287/opre.2014.1306
PY  - 2014///
AB  - We analyze a finite horizon periodic review joint pricing and inventory management model for a firm that replenishes and sells a product under the scarcity effect of inventory. The demand distribution in each period depends negatively on the sales price and customer-accessible inventory level at the beginning of the period. The firm can withhold or dispose of its on-hand inventory to deal with the scarcity effect. We show that a customer-accessible-inventory-dependent order-up-to/dispose-down-to/display-up-to list-price policy is optimal. Moreover, the optimal order-up-to/display-up-to and list-price levels are decreasing in the customer-accessible inventory level. When the scarcity effect of inventory is sufficiently strong, the firm should display no positive inventory and deliberately make every customer wait. The analysis of two important special cases wherein the firm cannot withhold or dispose of inventory delivers sharper insights showing that the inventory-dependent demand drives both optimal prices and order-up-to levels down. In addition, we demonstrate that an increase in the operational flexibility e.g., a higher salvage value or the inventory withholding opportunity mitigates the demand loss caused by high excess inventory and increases the optimal order-up-to levels and sales prices. We also generalize our model by incorporating responsive inventory reallocation after demand realizes. Finally, we perform extensive numerical studies to demonstrate that both the profit loss of ignoring the scarcity effect and the value of dynamic pricing under the scarcity effect are significant.

TI  - Effect of Inventory Management on Organisational Effectiveness
PY  - 2013///
AB  - The study of the “Effects of Inventory Management on Organizational Effectiveness in selected organizations in Enugu, was carried out, to asses the impact of proper inventory management on organizational performances in Emenite, Hardis & Dromedas and the Nigeria Bottling Company all in Enugu, Enugu State. Descriptive research method, especially survey and case study were employed in carrying out the study. The population of the study is six hundred and fifty eight (658). A sample size of two hundred and fouthy eight (248), was derived using the Taro Yamene formula for sample size determination from a finite population. Data were generated using questionnaire, oral interviews, observations, books, journals and the internet. Data were presented in tables and analyzed using simple percentages. Pearson product moment correlation coefficient and linear regression  was used in the hypotheses testing. From the analyses, it was discovered that irrespective of the fact that the organizations studied, painted the picture that they were applying the tenets of good inventory management, they from time to time run into the problems of inventory inadequacy. This consequently affected their production, leading to the scarcity of one brand of their products or the other, thereby affecting their profitability and consequential effectiveness negatively. The Findings indicate that there is significant relationship between good inventory management and organizational effectiveness. Inventory management has a significant effect on organizational productivity. There is highly positive correlation between good inventory management and organizational profitability. The study concluded that Inventory Management is very vital to the success and growth of organizations. The entire profitability of an organization is tied to the volume of products sold which has a direct relationship with the quality of the product Against this background the study recommended that Organizations should diversify their inventory system to suit specific needs of production, and that management should closely monitor and manipulate their inventory system to maintain production consistency for organizational profitability and effectiveness.

TI  - Just-in-Time application and implementation for building material management
DO  - 10.1080/01446199500000013
PY  - 1995///
AB  - Materials constitute a huge proportion of the cost of construction. Materials are sometimes ordered weeks or even months ahead of requirement leading to uneconomical inventory on construction sites or contractors' warehouses. Building material inventory represents cost to procure, cost to store and insure, cost to guard against theft and cost incurred when inventory becomes obsolete. This paper presents an overview of the Just-in-Time (JIT) production system and discusses application and implementation issues for the control of material inventory in building construction. JIT ensures that suppliers deliver directly to the production floor to achieve either a reduction in inventory or zero inventory and consequently a reduction in production costs. Implementation of JIT building material management in construction has the potential to realize the same far reaching benefits experienced in manufacturing. Relevant factors to consider in JIT implementation for material inventory management in construction are ...

TI  - On the Benefits of Risk Pooling in Inventory Management
DO  - 10.1111/J.1937-5956.2010.01134.X
PY  - 2011///
AB  - We analyze the benefits of inventory pooling in a multi-location newsvendor framework. Using a number of common demand distributions, as well as the distribution-free approximation, we compare the centralized (pooled) system with the decentralized (non-pooled) system. We investigate the sensitivity of the absolute and relative reduction in costs to the variability of demand and to the number of locations (facilities) being pooled. We show that for the distributions considered, the absolute benefit of risk pooling increases with variability, and the relative benefit stays fairly constant, as long as the coefficient of variation of demand stays in the low range. However, under high-variability conditions, both measures decrease to zero as the demand variability is increased. We show, through analytical results and computational experiments, that these effects are due to the different operating regimes exhibited by the system under different levels of variability: as the variability is increased, the system switches from the normal operation to the effective and then complete shutdown regimes; the decrease in the benefits of risk pooling is associated with the two latter stages. The centralization allows the system to remain in the normal operation regime under higher levels of variability compared to the decentralized system.

AB  - An important consideration in the design of educational programmes is the learning style of students. In the field of management education, Kolb's theory of learning styles has received particular attention. Research has shown, however, that his associated measure, the Learning Style Inventory (LSI), may be of doubtful utility. the present study of British and overseas managers examines the measurement properties of one alternative, Honey and Mumford's Learning Styles Questionnaire (LSQ). the results, calling into question Kolb's theory itself, suggest that the LSQ may be preferred to the LSI on account of the distribution of its scores, its temporal stability and its construct and face validity. Its predictive validity, however, remains in doubt.

TI  - Hospital Blood Inventory Practice: the factors affecting stock level and wastage
DO  - 10.1111/j.1365-3148.2009.00914.x
PY  - 2009///
AB  - summary To analyse the Issuable Stock Index (days worth of stock) and wastage in relation to data continuously collected by the Blood Stocks Management Scheme (BSMS) with aspects of blood inventory management practice determined by the 2006 hospital inventory practice survey (IPS). The BSMS collects blood inventory data from hospitals and blood services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Data sets were constructed from information obtained from the 2006 IPS, which included questions on the crossmatch reservation period, methods for calculating the blood order and stock share relationships between hospitals. Two of the Scheme’s measures that can indicate a hospital’s blood inventory management performance were used to present blood stock and wastage data in a comparable format. Data were analysed using the Student’s t‐test. The results showed significantly lower inventory and wastage in hospitals which used a 24‐h reservation period compared with 48 h (P = 0·02 and P = 0·04, respectively), and for hospitals that used their computer for calculating the blood order compared with those that used a ‘visual review’ (P = 0·02 and P ≤ 0·001, respectively). A strong correlation co‐efficient (0·61) was found for a relationship between a hospital’s stock level and wastage. The study showed that differences in stock management practice between hospitals are associated with significant differences in stock levels and wastage of blood. The paper identifies examples of best practice.

TI  - Simultaneous pricing and inventory management of deteriorating perishable products
DO  - 10.1007/s10479-014-1753-9
PY  - 2015///
AB  - This study addresses the problem of combined pricing and inventory control in the context of perishable goods—specifically, when demand is uncertain and price-sensitive and the consumers are free to choose between new and old units, based on the relative affordability of prices. First, the problem is formulated as a periodic review problem for a product with finite arbitrary lifetime and a myopic policy, which is often followed in practice, is discussed. Analytically it is shown that the solution obtained by the policy is also the unique solution that maximizes the individual profits from the inventories at each age. Next, this study addresses a special case—that of products with two-period lifetime, which is a scenario of practical importance. It is proven that under the policy of discounts and sticky pricing, which is often practiced in the brick-and-mortar retail stores, the myopic policy is in fact the steady-state optimal policy of the infinite-horizon problem. The study concludes with a numerical example and directions for future research in the area of joint pricing and inventory management of deteriorating, perishable products.

DO  - 10.2298/CSIS141101034S
PY  - 2015///
AB  - In today’s volatile and turbulent business environment, supply chains face great challenges when making supply and demand decisions. Making optimal inventory replenishment decision became critical for successful supply chain management. Existing traditional inventory management approaches and technologies showed as inadequate for these tasks. Current business environment requires new methods that incorporate more intelligent technologies and tools capable to make fast, accurate and reliable predictions. This paper deals with data mining applications for the supply chain inventory management. It describes the unified business intelligence semantic model, coupled with a data warehouse to employ data mining technology to provide accurate and up-to-date information for better inventory management decisions and to deliver this information to relevant decision makers in a user-friendly manner. Experiments carried out with the real data set, from the automotive industry, showed very good accuracy and performance of the model which makes it suitable for collaborative and more informed inventory decision making.

TI  - Adaptive inventory control models for supply chain management
DO  - 10.1007/S00170-004-2069-8
PY  - 2005///
AB  - Uncertainties inherent in customer demands make it difficult for supply chains to achieve just-in-time inventory replenishment, resulting in loosing sales opportunities or keeping excessive chain-wide inventories. In this paper, we propose two adaptive inventory-control models for a supply chain consisting of one supplier and multiple retailers. The one is a centralized model and the other is a decentralized model. The objective of the two models is to satisfy a target service level predefined for each retailer. The inventory-control parameters of the supplier and retailers are safety lead time and safety stocks, respectively. Unlike most extant inventory-control approaches, modelling the uncertainty of customer demand as a statistical distribution is not a prerequisite in the two models. Instead, using a reinforcement learning technique called action-value method, the control parameters are designed to adaptively change as customer-demand patterns changes. A simulation-based experiment was performed to compare the performance of the two inventory-control models.

PY  - 2004///
AB  - An important issue in the management of supply chains and manufacturing systems is to control inventory costs at different locations throughout the system while satisfying an end-customer service-level requirement. The challenge involved is to solve a nonlinear constrained optimization problem that captures the key dynamics of a complex production-inventory system. In this paper, we first develop a multistage inventory-queue model and a job-queue decomposition approach that evaluates the performance of serial manufacturing and supply systems with inventory control at every stage. We then present an efficient procedure to minimize the overall inventory in the system while meeting the required service level. Our technique is relatively simple and delivers accurate performance estimates. Furthermore, numerical studies generate certain managerial insights into related design and control issues.

PY  - 2008///
AB  - This paper focuses on the use of material planning methods to control material flow to inventories of purchased items. The first sub-objective is to evaluate the perceived planning performance of material planning methods used to control material flows in different inventory types in manufacturing and distribution companies. The second sub-objective is to evaluate the difference in perceived planning performance depending on the way planning parameters are determined and the methods used. Five material planning methods are studied: the re-order point method, the fixed order interval method, run-out time planning, Kanban and MRP. Our analysis is based on survey data from 153 manufacturing and 53 distribution companies. Findings conclude that the use of material planning methods differs depending on where along the material flow they are applied, whether the inventory is located in manufacturing or in distribution operations and between companies of various sizes. The modes of applying a material planning method affect its perceived performance. In particular, the way of determining and the review frequency of safety stocks and lead times have great importance for the planning performance of MRP methods, while the determination and review of order points, review frequencies and run-out times were important for re-order point methods.

TI  - Inventory and Supply Chain Management with Forecast Updates
DO  - 10.1007/b135819
PY  - 2005///
AB  - The book is concerned with the problems of inventory and supply chain decision making with information updating over time. The models considered include inventory decisions with multiple sources and delivery modes, supply-contract design and evaluation, contracts with exercise price, volume-flexible contracts allowing for spot-market purchase decisions, and competitive supply chains. Real problems are formulated into tractable mathematical models, which allow for an analysis of various approaches, and provide insights for better supply chain management. The book provides a unified treatment of these models, presents a critique of the existing results, and points out potential research directions. Attention is focused on solutions – that is, inventory decisions prior and subsequent to information updates and the impact of the quality of information on these decisions. Supply chain management research has attracted a great deal of attention over the past ten years. Moreover, it is an area of research that covers an enormous territory involving multiple disciplines. Supply chain management is studied and practiced in both academic as well as by practitioner circles. This is a book that is written for students, researchers, and practitioners across a number of domains including Operations Management Science, Operations Research, Applied Mathematics and Engineering.

TI  - Orlicky's Material Requirements Planning
PY  - 1994///
AB  - From the Publisher: Not much about MRP appeared in print until 1975, when its principles and precepts were set down by Joseph Orlicky in the first edition of this book. It soon became the "bible" of MRP, and played a major role in MRP's wide acceptance and success in the field. Now in this second edition, another MRP pioneer, George Plossl, brings Orlicky's seminal work up to date to meet the needs of today's manufacturing companies while retaining all of the outstanding features that made the original a best-selling classic. Orlicky's Material Requirements Planning forgoes much of the conventional wisdom about production and inventory control, and rejects such piecemeal measures as transplanting manufacturing practices from one company to another. With specific step-by-step implementation procedures it shows how the logic of MRP achieves a better balance between inventory input and output. It explains why inventory management is inseparable from production planning. It examines the effects of both independent and dependent demand on inventory control, and points out the weaknesses of such commonly accepted approaches as stock replenishment and order points (OP) while providing preferred MRP alternatives. Plossl also discusses driving present-day MRP programs effectively using time-phased master production schedules, structuring various types of bills of material (BoM), assigning a numbering system, setting up efficient files of inventory data, using shop calendars, and establishing realistic lead times for every purchased and manufactured item. Orlicky's Material Requirements Planning thoroughly covers all the important post-MRP developments such as the many uses of MRP output data, MRPII, Just-in-Time (JIT), and Total Quality Management (TQM). And it contains a full array of MRP applications, implementation problems to anticipate, and their most effective solutions.

For service facilities, typically inventory is used during the provision of service. We consider a system with Poisson arrivals, arbitrarily distributed service times and zero leadtimes. Optimal value of the maximum allowable inventory that minimizes the long-run expected cost rate is obtained in an elegant manner. Various examples of service distributions and optimal values for maximum inventory in each of these cases is also presented. Our analysis also yields a closed form expression of the stationary distribution for the embedded Markov chain of an M/G/l finite capacity queue

TI  - Two substitutable perishable product disaster inventory systems
DO  - 10.1007/s10479-014-1783-3
PY  - 2015///
AB  - A disaster inventory system is considered in which two substitutable items are stored for disaster management. In the event of disaster management, a particular product may become stock-out and the situation warrants that a demand for the particular product during its stock-out period may be substituted with another available similar product in the inventory. From the utility point of view, continuous review inventory models are quite appropriate in disaster inventory management. In this paper, a continuous review two substitutable perishable product disaster inventory model is proposed and analyzed. Since the inventory is maintained for disaster management, an adjustable joint reordering policy for replenishment is adopted. There is no lead time and the replenishment is instantaneous. For this model, some measures of system performance are obtained. The stationary behavior of the model is also considered. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the results obtained.

TI  - Forest Inventory in China: Status and Challenges
DO  - 10.1505/ifor.11.1.52
PY  - 2009///
AB  - SUMMARY Forest inventory in China provides valuable information on forestry policy formulation, forest management planning, and international forestry related reports. It includes the national forest inventory (Level I), the forest management planning inventory (Level II), and the forest operation design inventory (Level III) as the primary components. This paper describes the evolution of the inventory system focusing on forest inventories at levels I and II in terms of sampling strategy, plot design, output, and the application of information techniques. The current forest inventory system faces challenges in its transition from a forestry development strategy catered towards timber production in China to one where ecological-oriented management is the primary concern. At the same time, information needs to be expanded from local to national and international scales. Potential improvements are discussed that include sampling design, plot design, potential use of new remote sensing techniques as well as further data analysis.

TI  - An inventory model embedded in designing a supply contract
DO  - 10.1287/MNSC.43.2.184
PY  - 1997///
AB  - To reduce lead-time and its variability, modern supply and transportation contracts often specify the frequency of, and volume available for, future deliveries in advance even when final demand is somewhat uncertain (Yano and Gerchak [Yano, C. A., Y. Gerchak. 1989. Transportation contracts and safety stocks for just-in-time deliveries. Manufacturing and Oper. Management 2 314--330.]). We explore the joint optimization of contract parameters and inventory control policy in such environments. We first model and derive the optimal periodic review inventory policy corresponding to a given supply contract, which generates piecewise-linear convex ordering costs. The optimal policy has two critical levels, and there is a range of stock levels for which the quantity ordered equals the contract volume. To numerically compute the critical levels, we model consecutive inventory levels as a Markov Chain, whose steady-state distribution is used to compute the holding, shortage and transportation costs. We then use the resulting total costs to derive the optimal contract volume. Various examples are provided. The optimal contracted delivery frequency can also be computed.

TI  - An Integrated Supply Chain Management System: A Case Study in Healthcare Sector
DO  - 10.1007/11545163_22
PY  - 2005///
AB  - This research has designed and developed an integrated supply chain management (SCM) system for optimizing inventory control and reducing material handling costs of pharmaceutical products in healthcare sector. The supply chain in this work is composed of pharmaceutical companies, a wholesaler, and hospitals. At first, we have analyzed hospital's business processes and reviewed system requirements for the efficient supply chain management. VMI (Vendor-Managed Inventory), which is one of important applications of SCM, has been adopted and implemented to improve material handling efficiency. Online procurement system is also developed for the departments that consume drugs and place orders. Besides, real time information sharing functionalities are provided for optimizing inventory control of pharmaceuticals. The developed SCM system enables hospitals to improve the procurement processes and inventory control of pharmaceutical products, which results in decreasing total inventory more than 30%. By sharing information with hospitals, the wholesaler can gather more timely and exact data about inventory status and drug usage volumes of hospitals, so it can forecast the demand more accurately, which enables needed products to be supplied timely and cost-effectively. With the SCM system, total supply chain cost of pharmaceutical products has been decreased significantly.

TI  - Sales-Force Incentives and Inventory Management
DO  - 10.1287/msom.2.2.186.12351
PY  - 2000///
AB  - This article studies the problem of sales-force compensation by considering the impact of sales-force behavior on a firm's production and inventory system. The sales force's compensation package affects how the salespeople are going to exert their effort, which in turn determines the sales pattern for the firm's product and ultimately drives the performance of the firm's production and inventory system. In general, a smooth demand process facilitates production/inventory planning. Therefore, it is beneficial for a firm to induce its salespeople to exert effort in a way that actually smoothes the demand process. The article proposes a compensation package to induce such behavior. It evaluates and compensates the sales force on a moving-time-window basis, where the length of the time window is determined by the production lead time. Numerical examples show that the proposed package is beneficial to the firm relative to a widely used compensation plan based on annual quotas.

TI  - Inventory Dynamics and Business Cycles: What Has Changed?
DO  - 10.2139/ssrn.427741
PY  - 2003///
AB  - To what extent can information-technology led improvements in inventory management account for the apparent moderation of economic fluctuations in the United States since the mid-1980s? We argue that changes in inventory dynamics played a reinforcing-rather than a leading-role in the reduction of output volatility. Since the mid-1980s, inventory dynamics have changed in a manner consistent with a faster resolution of inventory imbalances. However, these changes appear to be a consequence of changes in the response of industry-level sales and aggregate economic activity to monetary policy shocks. Our results suggest that it is the interaction between the changes in inventory behavior at the industry level and the macroeconomic environment-where the latter likely includes changes in the conduct of monetary policy and the responses of the economy to policy disturbances-rather than any single factor, that has contributed importantly to the observed decline in economic volatility.

TI  - Assessing the discriminant validity of the Leadership Practices Inventory
DO  - 10.1348/096317901167334
PY  - 2001///
AB  - Theories of transformational leadership attempt to describe leadership behaviours which are associated with above average performance by subordinates. Kouzes' and Posner's (1987) visionary leadership describes five key transformational leadership behaviours which can be assessed by the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI: Kouzes & Posner, 1988). This study examined the construct validity of the LPI by using confirmatory factor analysis to test three alternate conceptual models. The sample consisted of 1400 subordinates who worked for an international finance company. It was concluded that LPI assessed an over-arching higher order transformational leadership. The implications of the findings for management development programmes were discussed.

TI  - Tactical capacity management under capacity flexibility
DO  - 10.1080/07408170701488052
PY  - 2008///
AB  - In many production systems a certain level of flexibility in the production capacity is either inherent or can be acquired. In that case, system costs may be decreased by managing the capacity and inventory in a joint fashion. In this paper we consider such a make-to-stock production environment with flexible capacity subject to periodic review under non-stationary stochastic demand, where we allow for positive fixed costs both for initiating production and for acquiring external capacity. Our focus is on tactical-level capacity management which refers to the determination of in-house production capacity while the operational-level integrated capacity and inventory management is executed in an optimal manner. We first develop a simple model to represent this relatively complicated problem. Then we elaborate on the characteristics of the general problem and provide the solution to some special cases. Finally, we develop several useful managerial insights as to the optimal capacity level, the effect of operating at a suboptimal capacity level and the value of utilizing flexible capacity.

TI  - Inventory Management Practices and Business Performance for Small-Scale Enterprises in Kenya
DO  - 10.4314/KJBM.V4I1
PY  - 2012///
AB  - Small-Scale Enterprises (SSEs) are acknowledged as significant contributors to economic growth through their perceived critical role in providing job opportunities, poverty reduction and their acting as intermediaries in trade. However, the International Labor Organization (2010) estimates that two-thirds of the enterprises generate incomes equal to or below the minimum wage, a sobering finding that must temper one’s enthusiasm for the growth of SSE’s as a solution to the country’s poverty and employment problems. Inventory constitutes much of the working capital held by SSEs and poor working capital management has been identified as one of the major causes of SSE failures. With this backdrop, this study investigated the relationship between inventory management practices and the business performance of SSEs in Kisii Municipality, Kenya. The relationship was probed based on primary data gathered by use of a structured questionnaire from 70 SSEs. The empirical results revealed a positive significant relationship between business performance and effective inventory management practices at 0.05 significance level. Further, they showed that inventory budgeting had the largest effect on business performance with a beta coefficient of 0.329, followed by shelf-space management with a beta coefficient of 0.30. Inventory level management had the least but significant effect with a beta coefficient of 0.297. The study suggests that owners/managers of SSEs embrace effective inventory management practices as a tactic to further their business performance.

TI  - Cash Management for Index Tracking
DO  - 10.2469/FAJ.V51.N6.1952
PY  - 1995///
AB  - Although all standard equity indexes have a zero weight in cash, managers running index-tracking portfolios often find that maintaining a positive cash holding is cost-efficient. This practice saves significantly on transaction costs because temporary cash inflows and outflows can be absorbed into the cash inventory. In this paper, a mean–variance framework is used to analyze the cash management problem for an index-tracking portfolio. The theoretical model is based on passive index tracking, but it has implications for any portfolio manager with an equity benchmark and random cash inflows and outflows.

TI  - Inbound Logistic Planning: Minimizing Transportation and Inventory Cost
DO  - 10.1287/trsc.1050.0130
PY  - 2006///
AB  - In today's competitive environment, supply chain management is a major concern for a company. Two of the key issues in supply chain management are transportation and inventory management. To achieve significant savings, companies should integrate these two issues instead of treating them separately. This paper considers the problem of selecting the appropriate distribution strategy for delivering a family of products from a set of suppliers to a set of plants so that the total transportation, pipeline inventory, and plant inventory costs are minimized. With reasonable assumptions, a simple model is presented to provide a good solution that can serve as a guideline for the design and implementation of the distribution network. Due to the plant inventory cost, the problem is formulated as a nonlinear integer programming problem. The problem is difficult to solve because the objective function is highly nonlinear and neither convex nor concave. A greedy heuristic is proposed to find an initial solution and an upper bound. A heuristic and a branch-and-bound algorithm are developed based on the Lagrangian relaxation of the nonlinear program. Computational experiments are performed, and based on the results we can conclude that the performance of the algorithms are promising.

TI  - US Fish and Wildlife Service 1979 wetland classification: A review
DO  - 10.1007/BF00045196
PY  - 1995///
AB  - In 1979 the US Fish and Wildlife Service published and adopted a classification of wetlands and deepwater habitats of the United States. The system was designed for use in a national inventory of wetlands. It was intended to be ecologically based, to furnish the mapping units needed for the inventory, and to provide national consistency in terminology and definition. We review the performance of the classification after 13 years of use. The definition of wetland is based on national lists of hydric soils and plants that occur in wetlands. Our experience suggests that wetland classifications must facilitate mapping and inventory because these data gathering functions are essential to management and preservation of the wetland resource, but the definitions and taxa must have ecological basis. The most serious problem faced in construction of the classification was lack of data for many of the diverse wetland types. Review of the performance of the classification suggests that, for the most part, it was successful in accomplishing its objectives, but that problem areas should be corrected and modification could strengthen its utility. The classification, at least in concept, could be applied outside the United States. Experience gained in use of the classification can furnish guidance as to pitfalls to be avoided in the wetland classification process.

TI  - INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, SERVICE LEVEL AND SAFETY STOCK
PY  - 2016///
AB  - There are many studies that emphasize as a first objective of inventory management to minimize the value invested in inventory because it has a direct impact on return on assets. This approach is not fully correct. The actual objective is to determine the value and the mix of inventory that support a high service level for customers and that maximizing the companies’ financial performance. Many companies look at their own demand fluctuations and assume that there are too many variables to predict demand variability. Service level is used in inventory management to measure the performance of inventory policies and represents the probability of not being stock-out and not losing sales. Safety stock is inventory that is carried to prevent stock outs. Safety stock determinations are not intended to eliminate all stock outs, just majority of them. Companies choose to keep safety stock level high as a buffer against demand variability resulting in inefficiencies and high working capital requirements. Safety stock optimization enables companies to achieve savings and increase inventory turns.

DO  - 10.1145/1873951.1874043
PY  - 2010///
AB  - Manual generation of a book inventory is time-consuming and tedious, while deployment of barcode and radio-frequency identification (RFID) management systems is costly and affordable only to large institutions. In this paper, we design and implement a mobile book recognition system for conveniently generating an inventory of books by snapping photos of a bookshelf with a smartphone. Since smartphones are becoming ubiquitous and affordable, our inventory management solution is cost-effective and very easy to deploy. Automatic and robust book recognition is achieved in our system using a combination of spine segmentation and bag-of-features image matching. At the same time, the location of each book is inferred from the smartphone's sensor readings, including accelerometer traces, digital compass measurements, and WiFi signatures. This location information is combined with the image recognition results to construct a location-aware book inventory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our book spine recognition and location estimation techniques in recognition experiments and in an actual mobile book recognition system.

TI  - Retail inventories and consumer choice
DO  - 10.1007/978-1-4615-4949-9_17
PY  - 1999///
AB  - In this chapter, we examine retail inventory management under consumer choice. Research on this topic is motivated by the simple recognition that consumers are frequently willing to buy a different color, size or brand within a product category if their preferred variant is either not offered or is offered but temporarily out of stock. In other words, faced with limited choices, consumers are often willing to substitute rather than go home empty handed. Intuitively, a retailer’s decisions about the level of variety they offer in an assortment and the quantity of inventory they stock ought to account for such behavior. Understanding precisely how choice behavior can be incorporated in inventory models and what impact it has on assortment decisions and operating performance are the main research challenges in this area.

TI  - Existence of Optimal Simple Policies for Discounted-Cost Inventory and Cash Management in Continuous Time
DO  - 10.1287/opre.26.4.620
PY  - 1978///
AB  - We formulate a continuous-time, infinite-horizon, discounted-cost cash management model with both fixed and proportional transactions costs and with linear holding and penalty costs. We model the cumulative demand for cash by a Wiener process with drift and use the optimal control technique of "impulse control" to find sufficient conditions under which an optimal policy exists. We show that these conditions are always met. Therefore, we prove that there always exists an optimal policy for the cash management problem and that this policy is of a simple form. When the proportional transactions cost of decreasing the cash balance is sufficiently high, it is never optimal to decrease the cash balance. Then the cash management model degenerates to the inventory model. We prove that there always exists an optimal policy for the inventory model and that this policy is of a simple form. Under special cases of the cash management model we obtain analytic expressions for the parameters of the optimal policy.

TI  - Wetland classification and inventory: A summary
DO  - 10.1007/BF00045199
PY  - 1995///
AB  - Regional, national and local wetland classifications have been developed and successfully applied. These have invariably been orientated towards conservation and management goals, and the information used to assess wetland loss or to assign management priorities. Existing national and regional classification systems have not only been useful, but they provide an essential base for developing an international system. At the international level, differences among existing systems in the definition of a wetland and how wetland types are defined assume great importance and need to be resolved. Classification is an essential prerequisite for wetland inventory. A number of international inventories have been undertaken, although these have not generally utilized the available high technology and data storage systems available through remote sensing and geographic information systems. More extensive international inventories will require standardization of techniques for data collection, storage and dissemination. A minimum data set needs to be defined with standards for data accuracy. An international committee under the auspices of an international agency (e.g. IWRB, Ramsar Bureau, IUCN) needs to be established to develop an international classification system and guidelines for carrying out a complete inventory of the world's wetlands.

TI  - A Monopolistic and Oligopolistic Stochastic Flow Revenue Management Model
DO  - 10.1287/opre.1060.0336
PY  - 2006///
AB  - This paper studies a one-shot inventory replenishment problem with dynamic pricing. The customer arrival rate is assumed to follow a geometric Brownian motion. Homogeneous customers have an isoelastic demand function and do not behave strategically. We find a closed-form optimal pricing policy, which utilizes current demand information. Under this pricing policy the inventory trajectory is deterministic, and a retailer sells all inventory. We show that dynamic pricing coordinated with the inventory decision achieves significantly higher profits than does static pricing. Furthermore, under oligopolistic competition we establish a weak perfect Bayesian equilibrium for the price and inventory replenishment game. We find the pricing equilibrium to be cooperative even in a noncooperative environment, but that inventory competition results in overstock and damages profits. Finally, we examine the trade-off between dynamic pricing and price precommitment and find that flexible pricing is still beneficial, provided competition is not too intense.

TI  - Inventory Management in Malaysian Construction Firms: Impact on Performance
PY  - 2012///
AB  - Managers act rationally in managing their inventory efficiently if they are convinced that the practice enhances firm performance. However, extant research in operations management has revealed divergent insights into the inventory-performance link. This study empirically examines the relationship between inventory management and firm performance and capital intensity on a sample of financial data for 82 construction firms in Malaysia for the period 2006–2010. By employing regression and correlation techniques, it was found that inventory management is positively correlated with firm performance. In addition, the results indicate that there is a positive relationship between inventory management and capital intensity.

DO  - 10.1023/A:1014950618756
PY  - 2002///
AB  - The Brief Stress and Coping Inventory (BSCI) was designed to gather stress and coping information from an individual in 15 minutes, compared to a nearly 1-hour completion time required for the parent instrument. All BSCI scales are described, along with our scoring methodology. Intercorrelations between scales are presented. Reliability and validity estimates were seen to be satisfactory to highly satisfactory. A multiple regression analysis identified 3 out of 8 scales that contributed significantly and uniquely to an optimal predictive equation for illness symptoms (R = .70). Frequency distributions of group results, which greatly help work site managers to understand results from stress management programs, are illustrated.

TI  - DETERMINISTIC APPROXIMATIONS FOR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AT SERVICE FACILITIES
DO  - 10.1080/07408179308964320
PY  - 1993///
AB  - We consider the problem of finding optimal inventory policies for a service facility where the demand for inventory occurs during the provision of service (e.g., fixing a car in a repair shop). The paper formulates a model where both the demand and service rates are assumed to be constant and deterministic. Consequently a queue forms only during stockouts. In the first of two models analyzed, the service rate is assumed to be fixed and cannot be controlled by the service facility. The ability to use this simple, deterministic model to approximate systems with probabilistic arrival and/or service distributions is also analyzed. The second model relaxes the assumption of a fixed service rate. Optimal inventory policies are derived under linear costs over ordering, inventory holding, customer waiting, and the service rate.

TI  - Inventory management of reusable surgical supplies
DO  - 10.1007/s10729-017-9397-3
PY  - 2018///
AB  - We investigate the inventory management practices for reusable surgical instruments that must be sterilized between uses. We study a hospital that outsources their sterilization services and model the inventory process as a discrete-time Markov chain. We present two base-stock inventory models, one that considers stockout-based substitution and one that does not. We derive the optimal base-stock level for the number of reusable instruments to hold in inventory, the expected service level, and investigate the implied cost of a stockout. We apply our theoretical results to a dataset collected from a surgical unit at a large tertiary care hospital specializing in colorectal operations. We demonstrate how to implement our model when determining base-stock levels for future capacity expansion and when considering alternative stockout protocols. Our analysis suggests that the hospital can reduce the number of reusable instrument sets held in inventory if on-site sterilization techniques (e.g., flash sterilization) are employed. Our results will guide future procurement decisions for surgical units based on costs and desired service levels.

TI  - Advances in Inventory Management: Dynamic Models
PY  - 2005///
AB  - textabstractIn this study, we develop and analyze models incorporating some of the dynamic aspects of inventory systems. In particular, we focus on two major themes to be analyzed separately: nonstationarity in demand rate and unfixed purchasing prices. In the first part of the study, we consider an inventory system with a nonstationary demand rate. In particular, we consider critical service parts subject to obsolescence. Inventory management of such items is notoriously difficult due to their slow moving character and the high risks involved when they are not available or no more needed. In practice, there is a need for policies tailored for service parts taking these aspects into account and easy to implement. We propose an obsolescence based control policy and investigate its performance and impact on costs. We find that ignoring obsolescence in the control policy increases costs significantly and early adaptation of base stock levels can lead to important savings. In the second part of the study, we consider an inventory system where the supplier offers price discounts at random points in time. We extend the literature by assuming a more general backordering structure. That is, when the system is out of stock, an arriving customer either decides to be backlogged with a certain probability or leaves the system and becomes a lost sale. We derive equations to calculate optimal policy parameters and demonstrate that allowing backorders in face of random deal offerings can result in considerable savings.

TI  - Impact of just-in-time (JIT) inventory system on efficiency, quality and flexibility among manufacturing sector, small and medium enterprise (SMEs) in South Africa
DO  - 10.5897/AJBM12.148
PY  - 2012///
AB  - The paper presents the findings of the study that was conducted to investigate the impact of application of Just-In-Time (JIT) inventory management system in the manufacturing sector SMEs. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to a sample of manufacturing sector SMEs in the food, wood and furniture, metals, non-metals and other industries. The study revealed that the majority of SMEs in the manufacturing sector were not applying the JIT inventory management principles. It was furthermore revealed that there are challenges impeding the implementation of JIT principles in the manufacturing sector SMEs. These challenges include lack of reliable supplier networks, lack of capital and lack of knowledge of immediate financial gains among others. Furthermore, statistically significant positive correlations between the application of JIT inventory management principles and cost efficiency, quality and flexibility were found. It is therefore deduced that manufacturing sector SMEs can benefit significantly in terms of improved quality of products, increased operational cost cuts and increased flexibility by applying the JIT inventory management principles.   Key words: South Africa, just-in-time, efficiency, quality, flexibility, small and medium enterprises.

AB  - We investigate M/M/1/∞-systems with inventory management, continuous review, exponentially distributed lead times and backordering. We compute performance measures and derive optimality conditions under different order policies. For performance measures, which are not explicitly at hand, we present an approximation scheme for all possible parameter combinations. Although we cannot completely determine analytically the steady state probabilities for the system we are able to derive functional relations between interesting probabilities and show surprising insensitivity properties of several performance measures. For the approximations we develop an algorithm adapted to the system structure which suggests easy adaption to other systems.

PY  - 2006///
AB  - We consider the application of revenue management to a make-to-order manufacturing company with limited inventory capacity. Orders with different profit margins arrive stochastically over an infinite time horizon and the company has to decide which orders to accept and which orders to reject. We model the problem with a discrete-time Markov decision process and propose a heuristic procedure. In numerical tests we show the potential benefit of using revenue management instead of a FCFS policy and assess the performance of the heuristic procedure.

TI  - Designing Service Level Agreements for Inventory Management
DO  - 10.1111/POMS.12033
PY  - 2013///
AB  - Service level agreements (SLAs) are widely employed forms of performance-based contracts in operations management. They compare performance during a period against a contracted service level and penalize outcomes exceeding some allowed deviation. SLAs have a number of design characteristics that need careful tuning to ensure that incentives are properly aligned. However, there is little theoretical research in this area. Using an example of an SLA for outsourcing inventory management, we make a number of recommendations. First it is preferable, if possible, that penalties be proportional to the underperformance rather than lump-sum ones. This goes a long way towards mitigating strategic (�gaming�) behavior by the supplier. Second, it might be thought that giving �bonuses for good performance� rather than �penalties for bad performance� are essentially identical apart from the former being a more positive approach to management. This turns out to be incorrect in the case of large percentage service rate targets and that penalties will normally be preferred by the buying firm. Third, in order not to incorrectly penalize underperformance resulting purely from �noise� rather than supplier efforts, management might think it best to make allowed deviations from the target generous. Again intuition is not a helpful guide here: for proportional penalties, acceptable performance deviations should be close to the target. Although these results come from a particular inventory application, it is likely that the lessons are applicable to SLAs in general.

DO  - 10.1080/00207721.2012.659701
PY  - 2013///
AB  - This study develops a model for inventory management consisting of a two-echelon supply chain (SC) with profit sharing and deteriorating items. The retailer and the supplier act as the leader and follower, in which the supplier faces a huge setup cost and economic order quantity ordering strategy. The market demand is affected by the sale price of the product, and the inventory has a deterioration rate following a Weibull distribution. The retailer executes three profit-sharing mechanisms to motivate the supplier to participate in SC optimisation and to extend the life cycle of the product. A search algorithm is developed to determine the solutions as using the profit-sharing mechanisms. The outcomes from numerical experiments demonstrate the profitability of the proposed model.

TI  - Perishable inventory management and dynamic pricing using RFID technology
DO  - 10.1007/BF02706255
PY  - 2005///
AB  - In price-sensitive markets, price promotions coupled with an appropriate item replenishment strategy can be effective in controlling the total costs of servicing the market. In supply chains that handle perishable products, inventory management is already a complex problem and the management of products in a dynamic-pricing environment is even more challenging. Monitoring and control of time-sensitive products can be facilitated by the application of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, which enables non-contact, real-time data collection and efficient interfacing with the management control system in the supply chain. This paper describes an integrated framework for inventory management and pricing in a discrete time (periodic review and ordering) framework, and describes an efficient algorithm, including a new approximation, for the related optimization problem. We then propose a suitable architecture for the application of RFID technology in this context, to realize the potential benefits.

DO  - 10.1006/JEMA.2001.0504
PY  - 2002///
AB  - The impact of urbanization on timber harvesting in the south central United States was investigated. Geo-referenced Census and Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) data were combined using a geographic information system (GIS) in order to examine the effects of various demographic and biophysical forest inventory characteristics on timber harvesting. These effects were estimated for intermediate and final harvests using a multinomial logit model. The probability for both types of harvests decreased with increasing population density, decreasing forest size, and decreasing distance to urban areas; however, the reduction in intermediate harvests was greater for each variable. Harvesting rates decreased by as much as 19% as population densities increased or distance to urban areas decreased. The results indicated that active forest management is curtailed far beyond the urban boundary. In order to model the impact of urbanization adequately, timber supply projections must also account for its impact on harvesting frequencies in surrounding areas.

TI  - NFI plots as complementary reference data in forest inventory based on airborne laser scanning and aerial photography in Finland
DO  - 10.14214/SF.983
PY  - 2014///
AB  - In Finland, there are currently two, parallel sample-plot-based forest inventory systems, which differ in their methodologies, sampling designs, and objectives. One is the National Forest Inventory (NFI), aimed at unbiased inventory results at national and regional level. The other is the Forest Centre’s management-oriented forest inventory based on interpretation of airborne laser scanning and aerial images, with the aim of locally accurate stand-level forest estimates. The National Forest Inventory utilises relascope sample plots with systematic cluster sampling. This inventory method is optimised for accuracy of regional volume estimates. In contrast, the management-oriented forest inventory utilises circular sample plots with an allocation system covering certain pre-defined forest classes in the inventory area. This method is optimised to produce reference data for interpretation of the remote-sensing materials in use. In this study, we tested the feasibility of the National Forest Inventory sample plots in provision of additional reference data for the management-oriented inventory. Various combinations of NFI plots and management inventory plots were tested in the interpretation of the laser and aerial-image data. Adding NFI plots in the reference data generally improved the accuracy of the volume estimates by tree species but not the estimates of total volume or stand mean height and diameter. The difference between the plot types in the NFI and management inventories causes difficulties in combination of the two datasets.

AB  - The crisis of emerging infectious disease stems from the absence of comprehensive taxonomic inventories of the world's parasites, which includes the world's pathogens. Recent technological developments raise hopes that the global inventory of species, including potential pathogens, can be accomplished in a timely and cost-effective manner. The phylogenetics revolution initiated by systematists provides a means by which information about pathogen transmission dynamics can be placed in a predictive framework. Increasingly, that information is widely available in digital form on the internet. Systematic biology is well positioned to play a crucial role in efforts to be proactive in the arena of emerging parasitic and infectious diseases.

AB  - This paper considers management strategies for the administration of a regional blood bank. The techniques of management science and mathematical inventory theory are applied to construct a model for the system, identify policy areas, and formulate management objectives. Two simulation models and data collected from both a regional and single hospital blood bank are used in the analysis. The results presented examine the interactions and savings associated with following optimal ordering, crossmatch, and issuing policies. Since each of these policies have an important effect on the number of shortages and outdates, they therefore influence optimal blood bank management. In addition, the question of centralized versus decentralized control is examined.

TI  - A Coordinated Production Planning Model with Capacity Expansion and Inventory Management
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.47.11.1562.10254
PY  - 2001///
AB  - Motivated by a problem faced by a large manufacturer of a consumer product, we explore the interaction between production planning and capacity acquisition decisions in environments with demand growth. We study a firm producing multiple items in a multiperiod environment where demand for items is known but varies over time with a long-term growth and possible short-term fluctuations. The production equipment is characterized by significant changeover time between the production of different items. While demand growth is gradual, capacity additions are discrete. Therefore, periods immediately following a machine purchase are characterized by excess machine capacity. We develop a mathematical programming model and an effective solution approach to determine the optimal capacity acquisition, production and inventory decisions over time. Through a computational study, we show the effectiveness of the solution approach in terms of solution quality and investigate the impact of product variety, cost of capital, and other important parameters on the capacity and inventory decisions. The computational results bring out some key insights--increasing product variety may not result in excessive inventory and even a substantial increase in set-up times or holding costs may not increase the total cost over the horizon in a significant manner due to the ability to acquire additional capacity. We also provide solutions and insights to the real problem that motivated this work.

TI  - A Linear Programming Approach to Production and Employment Scheduling
DO  - 10.1287/MANTECH.1.1.46
PY  - 1960///
AB  - The problem of production and employment scheduling may be stated as follows. Given the monthly demands for the product turned out by a factory, what should be the monthly production rates and work force levels in order to minimize the total cost of regular payroll and overtime, hiring and layoffs, inventory and shortages incurred during a given planning interval of several months? This problem has received a classical solution in two papers by Holt, Modigliani, Muth, and Simon (Holt, C. C., F. Modigliani, H. A. Simon. 1955. A linear decision rule for production and employment scheduling. Management Sci. (October); Holt, C. C., F. Modigliani, J. F. Muth. 1956. Derivation of a linear decision rule for production and employment. Management Sci. (January).). These authors assumed quadratic cost functions. Their treatment of the problem will be referred to as "quadratic programming." It appears, however, that in the majority of practical applications and theoretical models the cost functions are assumed to be linear. It, therefore, seems desirable to have a method of solution for the linear case as well. In this paper it is shown that a solution can be obtained by linear programming methods. From the linear programming viewpoint, this paper is of an expository nature. "Management Technology", ISSN 0542-4917, was published as a separate journal from 1960 to 1964. In 1965 it was merged into Management Science.

AB  - A centralized inventory system serves a number of stores with common ownership, and thus reliable and timely information sharing. Each of them pays a share of the inventory cost, and the reward structure leaves the owners of individual stores rewarded for their individual performance. Appropriate selection of a cost allocation method is important if such a centralized system is to last. In this work we propose three necessary criteria—stability (core of a related cooperative game), justifiability (consistency of benefits with costs), and polynomial computability. For a concrete example we demonstrate that common allocation procedures may not meet all three tests, and we present a method that that meets all three criteria. This kind of cost allocation analysis helps the common management to evaluate the trade-offs in choosing an allocation scheme for the cost of inventory centralization. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.49.9.1154.16573
PY  - 2003///
AB  - We consider a two-stage supply chain under centralized control. The downstream facility faces discrete stochastic demand and passes supply requests to the upstream facility. The upstream facilityalways meets the supply requests from downstream. If the upstream facility cannot meet the supply requests from inventory on hand, the shortage must be filled by expediting, which will incur per unit and setup costs. Such expediting may take the form of overtime production, which occurs at the end of the period and incurs relatively high production costs, or premium freight shipments, which involves building products at the beginning of the period they are needed and shipping them very quickly with relatively high shipping costs. We consider the case where one method of filling shortages is available and determine novel optimal inventory policies under centralized control. At both stages, threshold policies that depend only on the current inventory in the system are optimal; for the total inventory in the system, a base-stock policy is optimal. Numerical analysis provides insight into the optimal policies and allows us to compare the supply chains under centralized and decentralized control.

TI  - Inventory by Compartments
DO  - 10.1007/1-4020-4381-3_16
PY  - 2006///
AB  - Inventory by compartments is the method typically used for acquiring data for traditional forest management planning purposes. It is based on the concept of the forest stand, which is traditionally defined as a geographically contiguous parcel of land whose site type and growing stock is homogenous (e.g. Lihtonen 1959 p. 9, Ilvessalo 1965 p. 159, Davis and Johnson 1987 p. 29, Poso 1994 p. 95). In this context, compartment can almost be considered a synonym for forest stand, but a compartment must be also a suitable cutting unit or treatment unit for silvicultural measures and need not necessarily be as homogenous as a forest stand. Detailed forest management plans cannot be produced without compartment-wise estimates of site characteristics and growing stock and without silvicultural treatment proposals for each compartment. The latter must be made within the field inventory, because otherwise the planner has no way of ensuring that in the optimum solution to the forest management planning problem every compartment will be treated silviculturally in a feasible manner. Models describing forests and forestry in forest management planning packages (e.g. MELA, Siitonen et. al. 1996) are merely simplifications of reality. Sampling theory could be used to estimate the sample size needed to attain a certain required level of accuracy in estimates of growing stock, but if the compartments are small the sample sizes become so large that the inventories will be too expensive. In Nordic countries and in Central Europe, where compartments are rather small, a solution to the problem has been found in terms of a subjective method called “inventory by compartments”, which is partially based on visual assessment of the growing stock. Inventory by compartments will be illustrated in this chapter by describing a Finnish application. The area of forestry land in Finland is about 26 million ha, of which 60% is owned by private persons. All the forests owned by the state or by

TI  - Perishable inventory management system with a minimum volume constraint
DO  - 10.1057/jors.2010.181
PY  - 2011///
AB  - The federal government maintains large quantities of medical supplies in stock as part of its Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to protect the American public in case of a public health emergency. Managing these large perishable inventories effectively can help reduce the cost of the SNS and improves national security. In this paper, we propose a modified Economic Manufacturing Quantity (EMQ) model for perishable inventory with a minimum volume constraint, which is applicable to managing the inventory of medicines for the Strategic National Stockpile. We demonstrate that minimizing the cost of maintaining such a system can be formulated as a non-convex non-smooth unconstrained optimization problem. The property of this model is analysed and an efficient exact algorithm is presented to solve this problem. In the numerical experiment part, we perform sensitivity analysis on several government-controlled system parameters to illustrate how the government can obtain lower costs or a larger stockpile at the same cost by allowing more freedom in the management of the stocks.

TI  - Input and Output Inventories in General Equilibrium
DO  - 10.1111/j.1468-2354.2011.00664.x
PY  - 2011///
AB  - We build and estimate a two-sector (goods and services) dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with two types of inventories: materials (input) inventories facilitate the production of finished goods, while finished goods (output) inventories yield utility services. The model is estimated using Bayesian methods. The estimated model replicates the volatility and cyclicality of inventory investment and inventory-to-target ratios. Although inventories are an important element of the model's propagation mechanism, shocks to inventory efficiency or management are not an important source of business cycles. When the model is estimated over two subperiods (pre and post 1984), changes in the volatility of inventory shocks or in structural parameters associated with inventories, such as the input inventory to output ratio, play a small role in reducing the volatility of output.

TI  - Incentives for Efficient Inventory Management: The Role of Historical Cost
DO  - 10.1287/mnsc.1050.0360
PY  - 2005///
AB  - This paper examines inventory management from an incentive perspective. We show that when a manager has private information about future attainable revenues, the residual income performance measure based on historical cost can achieve optimal (second-best) incentives with regard to managerial effort as well as production and sales decisions. The LIFO (last-in-first-out) inventory flow rule is shown to be preferable to the FIFO (first-in-first-out) rule for the purpose of aligning incentives. Our analysis also finds support for the lower-of-cost-or-market inventory-valuation rule in situations where the manager receives new information after the initial contracting stage.

DO  - 10.1108/01443579910280287
PY  - 1999///
AB  - Service parts are needed for maintenance of industrial systems as well as for consumer products. Their logistics has an inherent difficulty: common models for inventory management are invalid, as the demand process is different and demand data scarce. The paper discusses experiences gained in case studies of practical stock control techniques. New concepts aimed to reduce the problem of slow moving parts are described, for example: suppliers leasing service parts; standardisation of parts for the group of machines in a factory or over a complete sector of industry; a “broker” between suppliers and customers who makes the service parts inventories transparent and facilitates pooling of parts.

PY  - 2016///
AB  - Abstract In this paper, we focus on inventory management in a manufacturing company in China. This study aims to identify the key factors that influence inventory management practices, investigate efficient and effective inventory management approaches, and examine the impact of supplier cooperation on supply chain improvement. A case study approach is used to identify the key factors that influence inventory management in a factory. Efficient and effective inventory management practices are derived from the case study and may provide practical guidance for foreign manufacturers in China. This study provides a valuable tool for identifying the key factors in inventory management which can be applied to similar problems encountered in actual manufactories.

TI  - Optimal Control of a Mean-Reverting Inventory
DO  - 10.1287/opre.1100.0835
PY  - 2010///
AB  - Motivated by empirical observations, we assume that the inventory level of a company follows a mean-reverting process. The objective of the management is to keep this inventory level as close as possible to a given target; there is a running cost associated with the difference between the actual inventory level and the target. If inventory deviates too much from the target, management may perform an intervention in the form of either a purchase or a sale of an amount of the goods. There are fixed and proportional costs associated with each intervention. The objective of this paper is to find the optimal inventory levels at which interventions should be performed as well as the magnitudes of the interventions to minimize the total cost. We solve this problem by applying the theory of stochastic impulse control. Our analysis yields the optimal policy, which at times exhibits a behavior that is not intuitive.

TI  - Should Inventory Policy Be Lean or Responsive? Evidence for US Public Companies
DO  - 10.2139/ssrn.2319834
PY  - 2007///
AB  - Using financial accounting panel data from the COMPUSTAT database for a universe of all inventory-carrying companies in the period from 1994 to 2003, we develop a statistical methodology that links managerial decisions about inventory with accounting returns. We find that, after we control for industry- and firm-specific effects, superior earnings are associated with appropriately defined responsiveness in inventory management. Specifically, we define responsiveness as the difference between the percentage change in inventory level (over time) and the percentage change in sales (over time), such that a positive (negative) responsiveness measure implies that inventory is growing (declining) relative to sales. We find evidence both across time and in a cross-section that current ROA (return on assets) and forwarded ROA are asymmetrically associated with inventory responsiveness. Namely, faster inventory growth and a faster decline relative to sales are both associated with lower profitability. Our findings are partially consistent with the intuition of investment analysts and managers, who use a similar measure of responsiveness in practice to predict/assess the financial performance of a company, and they are also consistent with the results of classical inventory models.

DO  - 10.1002/J.2158-1592.2005.TB00197.X
PY  - 2005///
AB  - Network design is a cornerstone of logistics management. It is traditionally used to determine the number and location of warehouses that optimize the joint transportation and fixed warehousing cost. We propose a network design model that enables managers to include inventory cost simultaneously with transportation and fixed warehouse cost in the optimization process. The proposed model treats inventory cost as a discrete function of the number of warehouses. The research also includes an illustration of the application of the proposed model using data obtained from a national retailer based in the Midwest. Results show that savings can be substantial and that the proposed model might also be used to define different configurations for C items than for A and B items.

TI  - Effect of Inventory Management Efficiency on Profitability: Current Evidence from the U.S. Manufacturing Industry
PY  - 2015///
AB  - ABSTRACTWhile manufacturing firms pursue efficient inventoiy management, there is limited evidence of improved financial performance related to inventory management practices. This paper examines financial statement data for U.S. manufacturing firms to explore the relationship between inventory management efficiency and firm profitability. The results show that a lower ratio of inventory to sales for a firm is associated with higher profit margin for the firm. In addition, small size firms can receive a larger benefit (as measured by profitability) from increased inventoiy efficiency when compared to medium and large size firms.Key words: Inventoiy Management, Profitability, U.S. Manufacturing Industry(ProQuest: ... denotes formulae omitted.)INTRODUCTIONMaintaining an appropriate level of inventory is a key issue to firms' operational performance. The supposition is that better inventory management is closely related with firms' better financial performance. Appropriate inventory levels depend on the production schedule as a managerial response to market demand. Inventory is a current asset to a firm, but it is costly to maintain as it waits to be converted into future sales. While excess inventory does increase costs, a shortage of inventory may result in lost sales. Prior research has focused on inventory management methods and optimal inventory sizes as they relate to the balance between more technological information systems, inventory cost savings and production/sales efficiency. Inventory management has evolved into a highly studied and practiced concept in the business world that combines optimizing inventory movement, information-sharing between buyer and seller, lean production strategies, and supply chain management concepts. The core of the current inventory management system is Just-In-Time (JIT) inventory systems.JIT is a philosophy of management that reduces waste and improves quality in all business process (Harrison and Hoek, 2011). JIT has been applied to many Japanese manufacturing firms since the 1970s (Cheng and Podolsky, 1996). JIT originated from the Toyota production system (TPS) and serves to reduce inventory and lead-time while increasing quality of production. JIT is defined as, "an inventory strategy aimed at improving a business' financial performance by reducing excess inventory and its associated cost" (Sungard, 2007). To implement a JIT inventory system, a sound, long-term relationship with suppliers is critical because suppliers have to fill the inventory as soon as it reaches a minimum level. Therefore, sharing information about the production schedule with part suppliers and delivery companies is essential. This information sharing is now available through a modem IT infrastructure utilizing the Internet and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP).ERP was introduced in the 1990s as an enterprise information system designed to integrate production and accounting data and functions across organizations. The main goal of ERP is to share data by all functional departments and to access the data immediately to increase prompt decision making (Motiwalla and Thompson, 2009). Together, the Internet and ERP systems dramatically improve the JIT inventory system, allowing real time information tracking and sharing of both production and accounting information. JIT inventory management and the utilization of Internet and ERP systems provides for a "lean production" opportunity.The concept of lean production is to minimize inventory and has been widely used since the 1990s (Eroglu and Hofer, 2011). JIT is the heart of the lean production systems. In the late 1990's, the JIT and ERP concepts expanded into a concept known as Supply Chain Management (SCM). The supply chain is defined as "management of network of interconnected business," to satisfy customers' requests (Harland, 1996).As stated above, the implementation of a technological complete inventory management system to determine an appropriate or optimal inventory level is a critical factor to a firms' financial performance. …

TI  - Service differentiation in spare parts inventory management
DO  - 10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602414
PY  - 2008///
AB  - The contemporary after-sales market is of increasing importance. One of the features required by the market is to provide differentiated service levels to different groups of customers. We use critical levels as a means to offer differentiation. Critical level policies aim to exploit the differences in target service levels by inventory rationing. In our multi-item single-location spare parts inventory model, we aim to minimize the spare parts provisioning cost, that is inventory holding and transportation cost, under the condition that aggregate mean waiting time constraints for all customer groups are met. In a computational experiment and a case study with data from a company in the semiconductor supplier industry, we show that significant cost reductions can be obtained when critical level policies are used instead of base stock policies (ie policies without critical levels).

AB  - The article examines the relation between working capital management and profitability for a sample of 66 Nigerian non-financial firms for the period 1997–2007. Trade credit policy and inventory policy are measured by number of days accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventories; and the cash conversion cycle (CCC) is used as a comprehensive measure of working capital management. The results suggest that firm’s profitability is reduced by lengthening the number of days accounts receivable, number of days of inventory and number of days accounts payable. The result shows that shortening the CCC improves the profitability of the firms.

PY  - 1999///
AB  - The Environmental Research and Education Foundation (EREF), in conjunction with Ecobalance and researchers from the University of Wisconsin and North Carolina State, is nearing completion of a comprehensive 2-year project on the life-cycle inventory (LCI) of a modern municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill. Data for the model came from both primary (over 100 landfills world-wide) and secondary data sources. Partners in the project included waste management companies from North America and Europe (including Waste Management Inc., SITA and CREED). In addition to the landfill LCI model, the project also includes the development of a software tool. The final report will provide a sound basis for assessing, on a life-cycle basis, the emissions and resource consumption associated with a modern MSW landfill. The model and report can be used to assess the importance of: ( 1 ) the various stages in the life- cycle system; (2) the time horizon selected; and (3) the air and water management techniques selected.

TI  - Models to Assess the Risk of Snow and Wind Damage in Pine, Spruce, and Birch Forests in Sweden

PY  - 1999///
AB  - 3 are damaged annually by snow and wind, roughly corresponding to a value of US$150 million, and in Europe, the damage amounts to hundreds of millions of US dollars each year. To help to reduce these losses, tools for risk assessment within forest management have been developed. Predictions were developed of the risk of damage from snow and wind to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] and Birch (Betula spp. L.) plots using tree, stand, and site characteristics. The data were obtained from 6756 permanent sample plots within the Swedish National Forest Inventory, which were inventoried twice at five-year intervals between 1983 and 1992. Input data for model development used measurements from the first inventory of tree characteristics for the largest sample tree, stand, and site data, and records of snow and wind damage from the second inventory. Models were developed for three different regions for pine- and spruce-dominated sites, while models for the whole country were developed for birch sites. In general the estimated proportion of damaged plots was highly overestimated (31.7%–56.2%), compared with the observed proportion of 3.4%–11.9%. The models for Norway spruce comprising tree, stand, and site data show the best predictability of damaged plots, with 60.6%–67.6% of plots correctly classified. It is concluded that the models developed can be used to detect sites with a high probability of damage from snow and wind, and thus be used as tools to reduce future damage and costs in practical forestry.

Management Science, April.) have suggested two methods for optimizing average costs per unit time by means of a sequential decision rule. This rule gives order quantities as a function of initial stock levels, and is based upon the assumption of a Markov process which is both homogenous and discrete. The formulation does not include any restrictive hypothesis on the structure of costs. This paper presents a synthesis of both dynamic and linear programming methods applicable to the same kind of model for the case of time discounting.

DO  - 10.15388/INFORMATICA.2013.392
PY  - 2013///
AB  - Inventory management is an important part of production planning process for enterprises. Decisions for strategies to determine when and how many to buy or make can be made by classifying the inventory items based on their sorts. In this evaluation, ABC inventory classification is one of the most commonly used approaches. In this study, a fuzzy analytic network process approach was proposed to determine the weights of the criteria and the scores of the inventory items were determined with simple additive weighting by using linguistic terms. Applying fuzzy ANP to a multi-criteria inventory classification problem is the novelty of this study in the related literature. In addition, the application area of the problem which is the management of the engineering vehicles' items in a construction firm is different from the other studies.

PY  - 2001///
AB  - The Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI; S. O.Lilienfeld & B. P. Andrews, 1996) is a self-report test that has shown considerable promise as a screening measure for psychopathy. A current limitation of the PPI is that no data exist regarding the impact of response sets such as positive impression management. Although the PPI contains a validity scale (Unlikely Virtues) designed to identify response biases such as “faking good,” its utility has not yet been assessed. In this study a repeated measures analogue design was employed in which 186 respondents completed the PPI both under standard conditions and with specific instructions to create a favorable impression of themselves. In the “fake good” condition, participants were able to appear significantly less psychopathic, with those who obtained higher scores in the standard instruction condition showing the largest decreases in their PPI scores. Receiver Operating Characteristic analyses indicated that, although the Unlikely Virtues scale significantly differentiated between “fake good” and honest protocols (area under the curve = .73), a considerable number of misclassifications occurred. The clinical and forensic implications of these findings are discussed.

DO  - 10.1080/13675560802141788
PY  - 2009///
AB  - Radio-frequency identification (RFID) as an emerging technology has generated an enormous amount of interest in the supply chain arena. There are a number of theoretical advantages of RFID technology. Inventory can be tracked more accurately in real time, resulting in reduced processing time and labour. More significantly, the complete visibility of accurate inventory data throughout the entire supply chain, from the manufacturing shop floor to warehouses to retail stores, brings opportunities for transformation and improvement in various processes of the supply chain. In this study, we investigate how these advantages can be utilised to improve the inventory performance of a supply chain. We identify the relevant results in the existing supply chain literature, and model the impact of RFID using computer simulation when we cannot find existing results. Our study provides a comprehensive view and some new insights on the potential benefits of RFID in terms of inventory reduction and service level improvement.

PY  - 2001///
AB  - We examined the reliability and validity of the research validity scales (Schinka, Kinder, & Kremer, 1997) for the NEO-Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-R) in a clinical sample. The Negative Presentation Management (NPM) and Positive Presentation Management (PPM) scales were found to have satisfactory internal consistency reliability. Support for the validity of these scales was provided by the pattern of convergent and discriminant correlations with respective Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) validity scales. Finally, PAI profiles of individuals with invalid NPM scores were found to differ significantly from those with valid NPM scores. Comparisons of the invalid profiles with profiles from other clinical samples provided additional support for the use of the NPM scale as a measure of negative impression management.

TI  - Inventory Types and Firm Performance: Vector Autoregressive and Vector Error Correction Models
DO  - 10.1111/J.2158-1592.2011.01019.X
PY  - 2011///
AB  - The effects of inventory management on firm performance have been well documented. Most previous research, however, has focused on the performance effects of total inventories and has ignored the potentially differential performance effects of raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods inventories. This research investigates the effects of various inventory types on firm performance. The empirical analyses of data from U.S. manufacturing industries reveal that the magnitude of the inventory–performance relationship varies by type of inventory and across industries. Specifically, raw materials inventories have a greater impact on firm performance than work-in-process and finished goods inventories. As a possible explanation, intertemporal interactions among these inventory types are explored using vector autoregressive and vector error correction models. The results suggest that raw materials and finished goods inventories asymmetrically affect each other over time. Implications for research and practice as well as future research opportunities are discussed.

TI  - Targeted Advertising on the Web with Inventory Management
DO  - 10.1287/inte.33.5.71.19248
PY  - 2003///
AB  - Companies that maintain Web sites can make considerable revenue by running advertisements, and they therefore compete to attract advertisers. The ability to deliver high click-through rates on a site can attract advertisers and, under an appropriate pricing model, can also increase revenue directly. Consequently, companies can benefit from delivery systems that display advertisements selectively to those visitors most likely to click though. To satisfy contractual obligations, however, these systems must simultaneously manage inventory. We developed a delivery system that maximizes click-through rate given inventory-management constraints in the form of advertisement quotas. The system uses predictive segments in conjunction with a linear program to perform the constrained optimization. Using a real Web site (msn.com), we demonstrated the efficacy of the system. We can generalize our system to find revenue-optimal advertisement schedules under a wide variety of pricing models.

TI  - A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Inventory Replenishment in Vendor-Managed Inventory Systems With Consignment Inventory
DO  - 10.1080/10429247.2010.11431878
PY  - 2010///
AB  - Abstract: In a Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) system, the supplier makes decisions of inventory management for the retailer; the retailer is not responsible for placing orders. There is a dearth of optimization models for replenishment strategies for VMI systems, and the industry relies on well-understood, but simple models, e.g., the newsvendor rule. In this article, we propose a methodology based on reinforcement learning, which is rooted in the Bellman equation, to determine a replenishment policy in a VMI system with consignment inventory. We also propose rules based on the newsvendor rule. Our numerical results show that our approach can outperform the newsvendor.

TI  - Comparative Evaluation of Life Cycle Assessment Models for Solid Waste Management
DO  - 10.1065/LCA2005.02.004
PY  - 2005///
AB  - This publication compares a selection of six different models developed in Europe and America by research organisations, industry associations and governmental institutions. The comparison of the models reveals the variations in the results and the differences in the conclusions of an LCA study done with these models. The models are compared by modelling a specific case - the waste management system of Dresden, Germany - with each model and an in-detail comparison of the life cycle inventory results. Moreover, a life cycle impact assessment shows if the LCA results of each model allows for comparable and consecutive conclusions, which do not contradict the conclusions derived from the other models' results. Furthermore, the influence of different level of detail in the life cycle inventory of the life cycle assessment is demonstrated. The model comparison revealed that the variations in the LCA results calculated by the models for the case show high variations and are not negligible. In some cases the high variations in results lead to contradictory conclusions concerning the environmental performance of the waste management processes. The static, linear modelling approach chosen by all models analysed is inappropriate for reflecting actual conditions. Moreover, it was found that although the models' approach to LCA is comparable on a general level, the level of detail implemented in the software tools is very different.

PY  - 2017///
AB  - Managing inventories, and thereby material flows, is of key importance for achieving efficient and sustainable supply chains. Green inventory management is characterized by complementing the traditional economic (cost) focus with environmental (emissions) considerations. In this chapter we identify and discuss key questions and challenges for green inventory management research. We do so by categorizing the costs and emissions of operating an inventory system into those associated with: ordering and transporting items, holding items in stock, and not satisfying customer demand on time. A literature overview illustrates what issues have been addressed so far in this emerging field. We conclude that there is a promising potential for green inventory management practices to reduce both costs and emissions, but much remains to be done. Not least in terms of developing more general green inventory models for practical use.

TI  - INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AUTOMATION AND THE PERFORMANCE OF SUPERMARKETS IN WESTERN KENYA
PY  - 2012///
AB  - In today’s highly competitive business environment, organizations from all industries are striving to achieve effectiveness, cost efficiencies and economies of scale. Most of these organizations hold inventory so as to meet their customers’ needs. However, managing these inventories in order to achieve their objectives has posed a great challenge to the firms. Many firms have not yet established how much to invest in inventories and the right inventory levels to hold so as satisfy customers. Organizations have therefore turned to using modern technology so as to overcome such challenges. Specifically, the study sought to address the following two objectives; to establish the extent of inventory management automation and to determine the effect of inventory management automation on the performance of supermarkets in Western Kenya. The study employed a descriptive survey design and targeted all the supermarkets in Kisumu, Kakamega and Bungoma. Data was collected from 11 out of the 12 targeted supermarkets and a response rate of 90.9% was achieved. Data was gathered using structured questionnaires and analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics, with the help of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The findings of the study revealed that inventory management automation affected the performance of the supermarkets and that there was a positive linear relationship between inventory management automation and the performance of the supermarkets. The linear regression model used revealed that 56.7% of the supermarkets’ performance could be explained by inventory management automation (r2=0.567). The extent of inventory management was found to be high among the supermarkets, with an overall mean score of 3.94, and the performance was also found to be high with an overall mean score of 4.1both variables being rated on a scale of 1 to 5. The study recommended that supermarkets should automate their inventory management systems so has to improve customer service delivery levels and reduce operational costs. It was also recommended that the supermarkets should decentralize their management structures, encourage specialization of labour and do enough research before investing in any new technology. The study suggested that further research should be conducted on the effect of inventory management automation on inventory investment and profits, effect of automation on demand forecasting accuracy as well as challenges faced by the supermarkets in automating their inventory management systems and how to overcome them.

TI  - Impact on inventory costs with consolidation of distribution centers
DO  - 10.1080/07408170108936811
PY  - 2001///
AB  - Abstract The consolidation of Distribution Centers (DCs) is a new trend in global logistics management, with a reduction in inventory costs often being cited as one of the main benefits. This paper uses an analytical modeling approach to study the impact on facility investment and inventory costs when several DCs are consolidated into a central DC. In particular, our model suggests that consolidation leads to lower total facility investment and inventory costs if the demands are identically and independently distributed, or when they follow independent but possibly nonidentical Poisson processes. This agrees with the conclusion of the classical EOQ and newsvendor models. However, we show by an example that, for general stochastic demand processes, the total facility investment and inventory costs of a consolidated system can be infinitely worse off than that of a decentralized system. This arises mainly because the order replenishment fixed cost yields a cost component proportional to the square root of the mean value of the demand, while the demand uncertainty yields a cost component proportional to the standard deviation of the demand. Whether consolidation is cost effective or not depends on the trade-off between these two components, as indicated by an extensive numerical study. We also propose an algorithm that solves for a distribution system with the total facility investment and inventory costs within √2 of the optimal.

AB  - Pilz, D.; Molina, R., eds. 1996. Managing forest ecosystems to conserve fungus diversity and sustain wild mushroom harvests. Gen. Tech. Rep. PNW-GTR-371. Portland, OR: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station. 104 p. Ecosystem management is the dominant paradigm for managing the forests of the Pacific Northwest. It integrates biological, ecological, geophysical, and silvicultural information to develop adaptive management practices that conserve biological diversity and maintain ecosystem functioning while meeting human needs for the sustainable production of forest products. Fungi are important components of forest ecosystem management because they perform essential ecological functions, many species are associated with late-successional forests, and commercial harvest of wild edible mushrooms contributes significantly to the regional economy. Inventory and monitoring provide essential information for improving management decisions, but fungi present a unique set of sampling challenges. To address these unique challenges, a conference entitled "Ecosystem Management of Forest Fungi" was convened May 3-4, 1994, in Corvallis, Oregon. This publication describes the forest management context of fungus inventory and monitoring issues, summarizes the mycological studies presented at the conference, and provides a synopsis of audience discussion. A common understanding of the challenges encountered when studying forest fungi will facilitate the planning and accomplishment of inventory and monitoring activities by improving communication among concerned individuals, interest groups, and land managers.

DO  - 10.1109/66.136270
PY  - 1992///
AB  - In manufacturing, higher priority is given to hot lots to reduce their cycle time. The impact of hot lots on the cycle time of other lots in the system is studied here. Object-oriented simulation experiments of a wafer fabrication model were run to investigate the above impact. The simulation results showed that as the proportion of hot lots in the work-in progress increases, both the average cycle time and the corresponding standard deviation for all other lots increase dramatically. Thus, it is argued that hot lots induce either a deterioration in service level for regular lots or an increase in inventory costs. Sound management accounting would require that these costs be estimated, possibly using an approach outlined here. >

TI  - Inventory performance of some supply chain inventory policies under impulse demands
DO  - 10.1080/00207540701689750
PY  - 2009///
AB  - This paper attempts to study the impact of impulsive demand disturbances on the inventory-based performance of some inventory control policies. The supply chain is modelled as a network of autonomous supply chain nodes. The customer places a constant demand except for a brief period of sudden and steep change in demand (called demand impulse). Under this setting, the behaviour of each inventory policy is analysed for inventory performance of each node. It is found that the independent decision-making by each node leads to a bullwhip effect in the supply chain whereby demand information is amplified and distorted. However, under a scenario where the retailer places a constant order irrespective of the end customer demand, the inventory variance was actually found to decrease along the supply chain. The variance of the inventory remained constant along the chain when only the actual demands are transmitted by each node. The results also showed that the inventory policy which is best for one supply chain node is generally less efficient from a supply chain perspective. Moreover, the policy which performs poorly for one node can be most efficient for the supply chain. In a way, our results also provide a case for coordinated inventory management in the supply chain where all members prepare a joint inventory management policy that is beneficial for all the supply chain nodes. The results have significant industrial implications.

PY  - 2015///
AB  - This study examines inventory management practices in flour milling manufacturing firms and their effects on operational performance. Five flour manufacturing firms with aggregate staff population of 2569 constituted the unit of study. From the population space, 150 respondents were randomly selected. Structured questionnaire was the major instrument for the collection of relevant primary data while mean and standard deviation was used to analyze descriptive data. Results showed that exception of the large manufacturing companies, most of the medium-sized flour milling firms adopts different inventory management strategies from the scientific models. Their inventory management strategies and policies were rather based on factors such as changing level of customer demand, prevailing industry practices, forecast estimates and guesses, and available production capacity. Findings also revealed significant differences between effective management of inventory and optimal operating performance. For instance, while firms that scientific inventory management approaches reported efficiency in capacity utilization, increased service level, and reduced lead time, others with unscientific strategies had minimal utilization of material resources. There is need for flour manufacturing firms to implement scientific inventory management models to adequately handle material shortages, product stock outs, and component pile up with consequent penalties.

AB  - We consider the case when n components are needed to assemble a given product. Components are provided by suppliers, and the period between the order time and the time a component is available (i.e., the lead time) is a random variable with a known distribution. The due date for the assembled product is also known. The costs to be taken into account are the inventory costs of the components and the backlogging cost of the assembled product. We propose an iterative algorithm which leads to the optimal order instants of the components. © 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

TI  - Inventory Optimization in Supply Chain Management using Genetic Algorithm
PY  - 2009///
AB  - Summary Inventory management plays a vital role in supply chain management. The service provided to the customer eventually gets enhanced once the efficient and effective management of inventory is carried out all through the supply chain. Thus the determination of the inventory to be held at various levels in a supply chain becomes inevitable so as to ensure minimal cost for the supply chain. Minimizing the total supply chain cost is meant for minimizing holding and shortage cost in the entire supply chain. The minimization of the total supply chain cost can only be achieved when optimization of the base stock level is carried out at each member of the supply chain. A serious issue in the implementation of the same is that the excess stock level and shortage level is not static for every period. In this paper, we have developed a new and efficient approach that works on Genetic Algorithms in order to distinctively determine the most probable excess stock level and shortage level required for inventory optimization in the supply chain such that the total supply chain cost is minimized.

TI  - The development of the Pain Management Inventory for patients with arthritis.
DO  - 10.1111/J.1365-2648.1996.TB02865.X
PY  - 2008///
AB  - The initial development of the Pain Management Inventory (PMI), a precise clinical index of pain management methods intended for use with patients with arthritis, is reported. The PMI differs from available instruments in its intent to assess specific methods that the individual is currently using for arthritis pain management and the perceived helpfulness of these methods, thus providing information to be used in combination with other clinical indicators for planning and evaluating ongoing pain self-management. Sixteen of 17 items, or methods, initially demonstrated content validity. Using methods appropriate for an index of independent items, psychometric testing with a sample of 82 persons having a primary diagnosis of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis then focused on estimating the construct validity and test-retest reliability of each item. Findings assist in better understanding how various methods relate to overall pain management when it is defined as successfully taking care of or handling the pain as viewed within a cognitive-behavioural framework. Findings suggest that there are eight items that represent valid and reliable pain management methods. These items should be used and evaluated with additional arthritis samples to determine whether the findings replicate.

TI  - Consignment stock of inventories in the presence of obsolescence
DO  - 10.1080/00207540500216631
PY  - 2005///
AB  - The Consignment Stock (CS) inventory policy is becoming an important strategy that companies adopt to face new manufacturing and supply chain management challenges. A CS policy implies great collaboration between the buyer and supplier, pushing them towards a complete exchange of information and a consistent sharing of management risks. In such a context, the effects of the obsolescence of products have to be carefully evaluated since they fall onto both actors, causing an increase in total supply chain costs. This paper proposes an analytical model able to take into account the effects of obsolescence in a supply chain managed with a CS policy. The deterministic single-vendor, single-buyer CS model is used as a base to develop the proposed model. A comparison with a non-obsolescence optimal solution available in the literature is presented. Moreover, the stochastic behaviour of the product lifetime estimation is also taken into consideration. Results demonstrate that the effects of obsolescence can consistently influence the global optimum condition.

TI  - Experimental Economics and Supply-Chain Management
PY  - 2002///
AB  - One area in which experimental economics methods have been used to study operations problems is supply-chain management. We survey results from a series of human experiments based on the popular beer distribution game and find cognitive limitations on the part of managers, in particular an underweighting of the supply line. We suggest mechanisms that may alleviate this bias, including sharing inventory and point-of-sale data, and reducing ordering and shipping delays. Our research provides managerial lessons and identifies supplychain issues that need further experimental study. (Games: group decisions. Inventory-production: multi-echelon.)

TI  - The Potential of RFID for Moveable Asset Management
PY  - 2003///
AB  - Moveable asset management is still not appropriately supported by existing IT systems. Items are not managed individually, information about location, status and usage is not accurate or lacking. This can cause delays in industrial operations, inefficient use or excess inventory of costly assets, and even lead to damages or accidents. We propose RFID technology as the key to link the necessary data directly with the physical asset. Assets become able to manage themselves, which eliminates many manually tasks, like searching for assets, inspecting for damages or counting them. The article demonstrates the potential of RFID based asset management solutions using the example of tool management in aircraft maintenance. The example includes the smart toolbox and smart tool inventory application as an implemented solution.

DO  - 10.1002/1520-6750(199202)39:1<29::AID-NAV3220390103>3.0.CO;2-L
PY  - 1992///
AB  - We develop approximations to estimate the expected backorders in a multiechelon system in which lateral supply actions between bases are allowed when a backorder occurs. These approximations are easy to compute, and the average absolute error over a wide range of parameter values is less than 4% when items are depot repairable, even when bases are dissimilar. With lateral supply, backorder reductions of 30-50% are not uncommon, and a 72% reduction was observed in two cases. Lateral supply becomes more important with low demand rates. A similar approach was unsuccessful for base-repairable items. However, lateral supply has a beneficial effect only when the lateral supply time is very short, 1/4 or less of the average base repair time. Even in such cases lateral supply is unlikely to be important in an actual application, because base management can expedite repair of critical items.

TI  - A Study on Relationship between Inventory Management and Company Performance : A Case Study of Textile Chain Store
DO  - 10.12720/joams.4.4.299-304
PY  - 2015///
AB  - This paper reports the findings of an applied research on inventory management at a textile chain store in Malaysia. It specifically examined the relationship between inventory management and company’s performance. Interviews with the company management were conducted to identify the inventory management issues and system used by the company. The relationship between the inventory management and company performance was determined based on inventory days and return on asset (ROA) analysis. The research found that company X had a few inventory problems such as unorganized inventory arrangement, large amount of inventory days / no cycle counting and no accurate records balance due to unskilled workers. The study also proved that there was a significant relationship between return on asset (ROA) and inventory days. This paper also provides recommendation to the company and for further research.

TI  - An Analysis of the Effects of Inventory Management on the Performance of the Procurement Function of Sugar Manufacturing Companies in the Western Kenya Sugar Belt
PY  - 2015///
AB  - The research project examined the effect of inventory management on performance of the procurement function of sugar manufacturing companies in the western sugar belt. The first objective established the significance of a lean inventory system on the performance of the procurement function of sugar manufacturing companies in the western sugar belt. The second objective found out how strategic supplier partnerships in inventory management affect the performance of the procurement function of sugar manufacturing companies in the western sugar belt. The third objective investigated the effect of information technology in inventory management on the performance of the procurement function of sugar manufacturing companies in the western sugar belt. The fourth objective examined the effect of the legal policies on inventory management in the sugar industry on the performance of the procurement function of sugar manufacturing companies in the western sugar belt. Descriptive research design, specifically a survey study was employed in carrying out the research. The target population of the study consisted of a sample of procurement personnel of Mumias Sugar Company, West Kenya Sugar Company, Nzoia Sugar Company and Butali Sugar Mills which was 30 procurement personnel out of the total target population that was 100 procurement personnel. The research instrument was structured questionnaires that were self administered to the respondents. Data was analyzed using SPSS and presented in tables and charts. The response rate was 87%. The ANOVA result for all variables indicated that there was a highly significant relationship between the variables at F = 2.727 and P = 0.000. This means that there is a strong relationship between the four variables; lean inventory systems, strategic supplier partnerships, information technology, legal policies and the effect of inventory management on performance of the procurement function of sugar manufacturing companies in the western sugar belt.

DO  - 10.1177/0972262913496726
PY  - 2013///
AB  - Inventory management augments business operations by effective flow of goods and services. It adds to profitability, competitive ability, service optimization, market diversification, etc. This article investigates the role of inventory management in fostering small firms’ growth. The research framework and hypotheses were examined by the empirical analysis of primary data collected from 44 functional manufacturing units sub-divided into ten lines of operation in district Udhampur, in Jammu & Kashmir (J&K). Validity and reliability of the scales in the construct were assessed through Bartlett’s Test of Sphercity (BTS) and Cronbach-alpha test. The results of regression model and analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that proper inventory management leads to economy and efficiency, nurtures competitive ability and paves way for cost reduction. Further results divulged that managers of different age group don’t significantly differ with regard to inventory control techniques. To promote inventory management, integrated strategic planning encompassing logistics, promotional-mix, technological capabilities and industrial promotion campaigns by government are needed.

TI  - Inventory Management in China: An Empirical Study
DO  - 10.1111/J.1937-5956.2012.01320.X
PY  - 2013///
AB  - With the outsourcing of manufacturing activities from Western countries, China has gradually become the global manufacturing hub. In the presence of increased competition from both inside and outside of China, many Chinese manufacturers have turned to scientific management approaches and implemented various enterprise systems. In academia, there has been a growing interest in quantifying the impacts of such efforts on the corporate performance of Chinese firms, and research has been carried out in areas such as finance and accounting. However, due to limited visibility of operational decisions and data, there seems to be a lack of investigation into the impacts on the firms’ operational performance in the literature. In this article, we apply an empirical method to investigate the inventories of 1286 firms listed on the two stock exchanges in China, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. We find that on average the inventory levels have declined over time and that the firm-level data is consistent with several implications derived from classical inventory models.

DO  - 10.1023/A:1018979107222
PY  - 1998///
AB  - We consider a combined time constrained ship routing and inventory managementproblem. A fleet of ships transports a single product between production and consumptionharbours. The transporter has the responsibility for keeping the stock level within its limitsat all actual harbours, and there should be no need to stop the production at any harboursdue to missing transportation possibilities. The number of arrivals to each harbour and thequantities loaded and discharged at each arrival are determined by the continuous productionrates at the harbours, the stock limits and the actual ships visiting the harbours. We use apath flow formulation for this planning problem, and generate paths for each ship includinginformation about the geographical route, the load quantity and start time at each harbourarrival. In addition, we generate paths for each harbour including information about thenumber of arrivals to the harbour, the load quantity and start time at each harbour arrival.We emphasise the formulation of the path generation problems which are subproblems inthe total planning problem. The generated paths appear as columns in a path flow problemwhich corresponds to a master problem. We use a column generation approach to solve thecontinuous problem. The solution is made integer optimal by branch-and-bound. Computationalresults indicate that a path flow formulation and an optimisation based solutionapproach work for real instances of the planning problem.

DO  - 10.1080/00224549809600415
PY  - 1998///
AB  - Abstract The relationship between impression management and cross-cultural adaptation was assessed. A sample of 112 individuals, 35 employees of a U.S.-based corporation and 77 undergraduate students, completed a packet of questionnaires containing M. Snyder's (1974) Self-Monitoring Scale, the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (D. L. Paulhus, 1988), the Cross-Cultural Adaptability Inventory (J. Meyers & C. Kelley, 1992), and the Cross-Cultural Interaction Inventory (T M. Yellen & S. J. Mumford, 1975). The individuals' scores on two impression management measures (the Self-Monitoring Scale and the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding) were found to be significantly correlated with responses on two cross-cultural adaptability measures (the Cross-Cultural Adaptability Inventory and the Cross-Cultural Interaction Inventory). The results suggest that impression management tendencies may be related to the ability to adapt cross-culturally.

AB  - With the recent improvement in cancer therapy, patients are living for extended periods of time. There is little information on the day-to-day problems that these patients experience. The paucity of such information is due to the absence of instruments specifically designed to document these problems. The authors have developed an instrument, The Cancer Inventory of Problem Situations (CIPS), and present a study of 84 cancer patients using the CIPS. Preliminary evaluation of the instrument in this small and heterogeneous group of patients demonstrates that cancer has a significant, extensive impact on psychosocial and physical functioning. Cancer patients have moderate to severe problems in personal care, activity management, involvement with the health care system, work, and interpersonal interactions.

PY  - 2006///
AB  - This paper describes a real-world application concerning the distribution in Portugal of frozen products of a world-wide food and beverage company. Its focus is the development of a model to support negotiations between a logistics operator and retailers, establishing a common basis for a co-operative scheme in supply chain management. A periodic review policy is adopted and an optimisation procedure based on the heuristic proposed by Viswanathan and Mathur (Mgmnt Sci., 1997, 43, 294–312) is used to devise guidelines for inventory replenishment frequencies and for the design of routes to be used in the distribution process. This provides an integrated approach of the two logistics functions—inventory management and routing—with the objective of minimising long-term average costs, considering an infinite time horizon. A framework to estimate inventory levels, namely safety stocks, is also presented. The model provides full information concerning the expected performance of the proposed solution, which can be compared against the present situation, allowing each party to assess its benefits and drawbacks.

TI  - Air Emission Inventories in North America: A Critical Assessment
DO  - 10.1080/10473289.2006.10464540
PY  - 2006///
AB  - Abstract Although emission inventories are the foundation of air quality management and have supported substantial improvements in North American air quality, they have a number of shortcomings that can potentially lead to ineffective air quality management strategies. Major reductions in the largest emissions sources have made accurate inventories of previously minor sources much more important to the understanding and improvement of local air quality. Changes in manufacturing processes, industry types, vehicle technologies, and metropolitan infrastructure are occurring at an increasingly rapid pace, emphasizing the importance of inventories that reflect current conditions. New technologies for measuring source emissions and ambient pollutant concentrations, both at the point of emissions and from remote platforms, are providing novel approaches to collecting data for inventory developers. Advances in information technologies are allowing data to be shared more quickly, more easily, and processed and compared in novel ways that can speed the development of emission inventories. Approaches to improving quantitative measures of inventory uncertainty allow air quality management decisions to take into account the uncertainties associated with emissions estimates, providing more accurate projections of how well alternative strategies may work. This paper discusses applications of these technologies and techniques to improve the accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of emission inventories across North America and outlines a series of eight recommendations aimed at inventory developers and air quality management decision-makers to improve emission inventories and enable them to support effective air quality management decisions for the foreseeable future.

AB  - The use of RFID technology has increased in libraries where it is the centerpiece of emerging automated self-checkout, return, and theft detection systems. In this paper, we present LibBot, a robot equipped with an RFID reader, that automates the otherwise manual shelf-reading process and finds misplaced books autonomously. Our experiments with a single library shelf show that our robot-assisted approach to inventory management can not only detect misplaced books reliably, but also correctly determine the order of the books on the shelves and even localize each book with an accuracy of a few centimeters. Our work also shows to what extent RFID challenges such as metal shelves and thin books with RFID tags in close proximity affect the location accuracy.

AB  - Radio frequency identification (RFID) is an enabling technology that promises to create value through greater visibility in supply chain networks, higher product velocity, more efficient inventory management, reduced labor cost, and reduced human error. However, it is still not clear if these objectives can be fully achieved due to high tag costs and uncertain return-of-investment (ROI). We introduce the key components and concepts of RFID applications and identify key issues when implementing RFID in supply chain networks. We suggest an RFID integration model that allows for degrees of integration breadth.

DO  - 10.1287/MNSC.33.6.756
PY  - 1987///
AB  - This paper extends the deterministic EOQ model to reflect various optimizing criteria and alternative demand and price structures. Its primary purpose is to develop decision rules for the management of finished goods inventories, especially in retailing, where inventories are evaluated in the same way as any other investment, namely on their ability to generate profits, rather than on the traditional least-cost basis. To that effect, the models developed here consider demand to be a function of price, with price defined as a markup of unit cost. The decision variables are the order quantity and the markup rate. Possible optimizing objectives include profits, return on investment, or residual income, the three most widely used evaluators of short-term investment performance. Optimal solutions for each case are obtained and the resulting inventory policies evaluated.

By using the theory of constraints (TOCs), this study diagnoses the undesirable effects (UDEs) of material management systems and identifies root problems or conflicting material management actions. In the second step, via UDEs, this study constructs a current reality tree (CRT) to identify a company's material management objectives and requirements, and the actions it takes to meet these objectives. In addition, the UDEs and CRT are applied to redesign the future reality tree (FRT) to develop strategies and eliminate the problems in the case company. By eliminating the conflicting inventory management activities of different departments, inventory management performance for the entire system is improved.

TI  - Blood inventory management
DO  - 10.1111/J.1741-6892.2004.00472.X
PY  - 2004///
AB  - Over 75 million units of blood are donated world-wide every year [1]. Blood services and centres rely on the goodwill of voluntary donors for the supply of blood. Despite the importance of blood transfusion to health care the donor base is diminishing for a variety of reasons including increased donor deferral and donor complacency. The fragile nature of the blood supply emphasizes the role of effective stock management both within blood services and the hospitals that they supply. Various factors are implicit in stock management including supply and demand, inventory levels both within the blood service and hospitals and clinics, stock management practices and distribution logistics. Inventory monitoring can help increase our understanding of influences on the blood supply chain.

TI  - The Inventory Approach to Urban Growth Boundaries
DO  - 10.1080/01944360108976238
PY  - 2001///
AB  - Abstract In this article, we argue that insights can be gained by analyzing the use of urban growth boundaries (UGBs) for urban growth management as an inventory problem. The analysis provides three useful insights. First, it shows that where UGBs are employed, too much emphasis is placed on whether UGBs contain sufficient land to accommodate 20 years of growth and too little is placed on how frequently, how much, or under what circumstances UGBs should be expanded. Second, it shows that where market factors are used, they have been used inappropriately to increase the size of UGBs immediately after expansion, when they should be used to influence the size of UGBs immediately before expansion. Third, it shows that UGBs are likely to work better if expansions occur not after an arbitrary period of time, but when the supply—or the price—of land reaches some critical threshold. We conclude by asserting that the use of UGBs should not be governed by arbitrary rules of thumb, because such rules do not stand up to critical examination, they preclude adaptation to local situations, and they prevent experimentation.

TI  - Managing Inventory with the Prospect of Obsolescence
DO  - 10.1287/opre.44.1.215
PY  - 1996///
AB  - How should inventory management respond when there is a possibility of imminent obsolescence or, more generally, deteriorating demand? We use an inventory-control model to address this question. The model incorporates a Markovian submodel to describe the uncertain events leading to obsolescence. These events and their uncertainties come in a variety of patterns. We devote considerable attention to specifying the submodel, and we compare a few alternatives numerically. Also, we compare optimal policies to simpler alternatives, and we investigate the response of the model to parameter changes. Generally, we find that obsolescence does or should have a substantial impact in the way inventories are managed. The nature of these effects, moreover, is fairly intricate. It appears that obsolescence cannot be captured in a simpler model through parameter adjustments. These conclusions presume that we cannot dispose of excess stock, either directly or through price promotions; we show also that the disposal option can make the problems of obsolescence more manageable.

TI  - Production order quantity for economical and quality consideration
DO  - 10.1243/09544054JEM1665
PY  - 2010///
AB  - Abstract In the conventional production-inventory management approach, the production order quantity is determined by referring to costs such as the ordering cost and inventory cost. However, the quality level being produced may change during the production process owing to process deterioration. Thus, under process deterioration, a production order quantity based solely on the conventional production-inventory management system may be overproduced, due to a lack of consideration of varied quality costs at different points of time, along with the production run length. Hence, for cyclical quality promotion and cost reduction, there is a motivation to extend the conventional production-inventory management approach by adding the process-quality design approach which considers the varied quality-related costs as a function of time. The decision variables include the initial setting, process tolerance, and production order quantity, which have to be determined simultaneously for true optimization so that the average total cost, which includes the setup cost for production reordering and process resetting, quality loss, and tolerance cost for process quality, and the inventory cost for production inventory, is minimized. An example of a production process subject to process deterioration is presented for illustrating the possible application of the proposed model.

TI  - THEORY OF INVENTORY MANAGEMENT BASED ON DEMAND
PY  - 2011///
AB  - Efficient management of supply chains consists in particular in ensuring possibly highest quality of customer service and striving for minimization of the costs generated by flow between the links. Typical cause of constantly increasing costs is excessive inventory levels throughout the chain. The reason for this situation is maladjustment of the level of supply to the level of demand in the market, which results in surplus stock. The starting point for reduction in inventory levels is forecasting of demand in the market through market prognoses in cooperation with all the links in the supply chain. Therefore, in the aspect of demand forecasting, the character of data flow and the type of cooperation between the links is essential.

TI  - Zero inventory and firm performance: a management paradigm revisited
DO  - 10.1080/00207543.2011.613869
PY  - 2012///
AB  - According to the ‘zero inventory’ paradigm, inventory reflects waste and should be eliminated in order for performance to rise. In this study, we investigate the effect of inventory holding on firm performance, analysing 3057 firm years of data. Interpreting performance as a function of inventory, results show that firms with the lowest inventory have the worst performance (and vice versa). When understanding inventory as a function of performance, results indicate that low-performing firms carry the least inventory, whereas high-performing firms have the highest stocks. Besides questions of causality, our results do not support a paradigm which suggests that firms should move toward zero inventory.

DO  - 10.1109/INTERACT.2010.5706151
PY  - 2010///
AB  - This paper demonstrates the application of Line Following Robot (LFR) for library inventory management system (LIMS). A line following robot is designed using sensor operated motors to keep track the line path predetermined for library book shelf arrangements. The robot carries a barcode reader which collects the barcode data from the books arranged in a vertical manner and compares the decoded barcode data with the search input. If the robot reaches the book which is to be found out, then the robot gives location of the book to the librarian or the person visiting the library, in which the robot is used for searching purpose. In case of any hindrance faced by the robot when it does the searching process, the robot halts and sends an alarm. Misplaced books can be rearranged using the pre-programmed data in the robot which helps to maintain the books in an order. This helps and simplifies the job of arranging the books and also reduces the manual routine work done by the library staff.

AB  - Option pricing is a common and important practice in the financial community, and has become a fundamental theoretical construct in financial economics. The theory is quite rich and has potential uses in many other problem domains. This paper develops a variant of the theory as applied to inventory planning. In particular, we consider a risk management approach that uses negotiated option contracts for hedging against price and quantity uncertainty in inventory procurement. We derive conditions for the inclusion of options in inventory control as a function both of managerial attitudes toward risk and of the correlation between price and demand.

DO  - 10.2737/WO-GTR-73
PY  - 2006///
AB  - The National Forest Management Act (1976) recognizes the importance of maintaining species and community diversity on National Forest System (NFS) lands as a critical component of our ecological and cultural heritage. Monitoring is required of land management to assess the success of management activities in meeting legal, regulatory, and policy objectives, including sustaining populations of native and desired nonnative species. The Multiple Species Inventory and Monitoring (MSIM) protocol is intended to serve as a consistent and efficient method for obtaining basic presence/absence data and associated habitat condition data for a large number of individual species at sites that represent a probabilistic sample. It is designed to be implemented in association with Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) grid points on NFS lands. The MSIM protocol is designed as a base monitoring approach on which regions and forests can build to meet their specific National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan monitoring needs with the greatest possible efficiency (measured as the amount of useful and high-quality information gained per unit cost).

DO  - 10.1139/X02-199
PY  - 2003///
AB  - Multisource forest inventory with two-phase sampling offers several advantages in the forest management planning when compared with the traditional visual inventory by stands. For example, by combining data from remote sensing imagery with field measurements, it is possible to estimate the forest characteristics of large areas at a more reasonable cost than by using the traditional visual inventory by stands. In this study, the k-nearest-neighbours estimation (k-nn), stand inventory data, and geostatistical interpolation were combined for estimation of five forest variables (mean diameter, mean height, mean age, basal area, and volume) per sample plot and stand. Digitized aerial photograph features, visually interpreted aerial photograph features, and updated stand inventory data were used as the auxiliary data sources in the estimation of forest variables. The results show that, at the sample plot level, the k-nn estimates based on the auxiliary data sources were more accurate than the updated stand inve...

PY  - 2007///
AB  - Traditionally, inventory problems for the vendor and the buyer are treated separately. In modern enterprises, however, the integration of vendor–buyer inventory system is an important issue. This co-operative approach to inventory management contributes to the success of supply chain management by minimizing the joint inventory cost. The joint inventory cost and the response time can further be reduced when the buyer orders and the vendor replenishes the required items just in time (JIT) for their consumption. The inclusion of the JIT concept in this model contributes significantly to a joint inventory cost reduction. A numerical example and sensitivity analysis are carried out. The derived results show an impressive cost reduction when compared with Goyal’s model.

PY  - 1979///
AB  - The critical importance of integrating production, distribution, and inventory PDI operations has long been recognized by top management of many companies. Now, using the latest advances in Management Science modeling and solution technology, an integrated computer-based PDI system has saved approximately $18 million dollars during its first three years of implementation for a major national firm, Agrico Chemical Company. According to the Vice-President of Agrico Supply and Distribution, an additional $25 million savings is anticipated over the next two years. Brought about by close cooperation between company officials and an outside staff of Management Science consultants, the PDI system has been used extensively to evaluate the benefit/cost impact of alternative capital investments in both short-term and long-term planning decisions. The development of the system underscores the value of recent Management Science innovations that have made it possible to analyze interacting influences too numerous and complex to be analyzed adequately only a few years ago. Advanced network methodology incorporated into the PDI system required only one one-hundredth of the computer time and cost of methodologies previously used. The power and flexibility of the new Management Science tools have also brought about increased communication and understanding of key company operations. This increased communication and understanding stems from the inherent “pictorial” nature of network-based models, which facilitates interpretation of these models and policy recommendations based upon their solution.

TI  - Analysis of stock management gaming experiments and alternative ordering formulations
DO  - 10.1002/SRES.643
PY  - 2004///
AB  - This paper investigates two different yet related research questions about stock management in feedback environments. The first purpose is to analyse the effects of selected experimental factors on the performances of subjects (players) in a stock management simulation game. In light of these results, our second objective is to evaluate the adequacy of standard decision rules typically used in dynamic stock management models and to seek improvement formulations. To carry out the research, the generic stock management problem is chosen as the interactive gaming platform. In the first part, gaming experiments are designed to test the effects of three factors on decision-making behaviour: different patterns of customer demand, minimum possible order decision (‘review’) interval and, finally, the type of receiving delay. ANOVA results of these three-factor, two-level experiments show which factors have significant effects on 10 different measures of behaviour (such as max–min range of orders, inventory amplitudes, periods of oscillations and backlog durations). In the second phase of research, the performances of subjects are compared against some selected ordering heuristics (formulations). First, the patterns of ordering behaviour of subjects are classified into three basic types. Comparing these three pattern types with simulation results using different decision rules, we observe that the common linear ‘anchoring and adjustment rule’ can represent the smooth and gradually damping type of behaviour, but cannot generate the non-linear and/or discrete ordering dynamics. Thus, several alternative non-linear rules are formulated and tested against subjects' behaviour patterns. Some standard discrete inventory control rules (such as (s, S)) common in the inventory management literature are also formulated and tested. These non-linear and/or discrete rules, compared with the linear stock adjustment rule, are found to be more representative of the subjects' ordering behaviour in many cases, in the sense that these rules can generate non-linear and/or discrete ordering behaviours. Another major finding is the fact that the well-documented oscillatory dynamic behaviour of the inventory is a quite general result, not just an artifact of the linear anchor and adjust rule. When the supply line is ignored or underestimated, large inventory oscillations result also with the non-linear rules, as well as the standard inventory management rules. Furthermore, depending on parameter values, non-linear ordering rules are more prone to yield unstable oscillations—even if the supply line is taken into account. Further methodological and experimental research questions are suggested. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Developing Inventory Management in Hospital
PY  - 2015///
AB  - Single inventory policy has been applied to entire types of drugs in hospitals, despite several different drug and demand characteristics. Shortages regularly occur, which may affect patients’ lives, especially when vital drugs are being administered to them. However, hospitals cannot store a large amount of every drug because of limited space and budget. The objective of this study was to develop a hospital inventory management system to minimise the total inventory costs, while maintaining patient safety levels. This study is concerned only with the medicines that have a high consumption value and took place in a large public hospital in Thailand. The most suitable policies are proposed for each drug category with the best performance obtained.The historical demand is classified by drug characteristics, consumption value and clinical importance, as well as the demand characteristics. We applied it and compared it with the current inventory policy (Min/Max), and inventory policies from previous studies, in order to investigate the most suitable inventory policy for each drug category and demand characteristic. The study found that a single inventory management system cannot be effectively applied for all medicines. This is because there are also categories of medicines characterised by their value and clinical importance. This is called the ABC/VEN classification. The inventory management in hospitals should be fitted to drug categories and demand characteristics, which are quite unique in the healthcare supply chain and are different from those applied to [KK1]  general manufacturing.

TI  - The Economic Order-Quantity (EOQ) Model
DO  - 10.1007/978-0-387-73699-0_8
PY  - 2008///
AB  - The economic order-quantity model considers the tradeoff between ordering cost and storage cost in choosing the quantity to use in replenishing item inventories. A larger order-quantity reduces ordering frequency, and, hence ordering cost/ month, but requires holding a larger average inventory, which increases storage (holding) cost/month. On the other hand, a smaller order-quantity reduces average inventory but requires more frequent ordering and higher ordering cost/month. The cost- minimizing order-quantity is called the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ). This chapter builds intuition about the robustness of EOQ, which makes the model useful for management decision-making even if its inputs (parameters) are only known to be within a range of possible values. This chapter also provides intuition about choosing an inventory-management system, not just an EOQ.

TI  - A Method for Improving the Management of Controversial Wetland
DO  - 10.1007/S00267-004-0391-4
PY  - 2006///
AB  - Valley bottom wetlands in agricultural landscapes often are neglected in national and regional wetland inventories. Although these areas are small, located in the bottomlands of the headwater catchments, and scattered in the rural landscape, they strongly influence hydrology, water quality, and biodiversity over the whole catchment area. Valley bottom wetlands often are considered as controversial wetlands. Awareness of the functional role of wetlands is increasing, in parallel with their progressive disappearance in intensive farming landscapes. The need to improve tools for controlling wetland management is a primary consideration for decision makers and land users. This article proposes a method for the inventory of valley bottom wetlands. The method is based on the functional analysis of potential, existing, and efficient valley bottom wetlands (the PEEW approach). Several indicators are proposed for checking the validity of such an approach. Potential wetlands are delineated by means of a topographic index using topographic and pedoclimatic criteria computed from a Digital Elevation Model and easily accessible databases. Existing wetlands are identified from observed surface moisture, the presence of specific wetland vegetation, or soil feature criteria. Efficient wetlands are defined through a given function, such as flow or pollutant regulation or biodiversity control. An analysis of areas at the limits between potential, existing, and efficient wetlands highlights land cultivated or drained in the past, which currently represents negotiating areas in which rehabilitation and other intended management actions can be implemented.

DO  - 10.1108/09576050310467250
PY  - 2003///
AB  - Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems provide functions to calculate safety stock (SS), make demand forecast and determine reorder point (ROP) for each item contained in the database based on the item’s demand history. Most ERP systems are ill‐equipped to deal with the demand of slow moving items such as spare parts. Based on data from a Fortune 500 company, presents the development and evaluation of a spare parts inventory control model. Compares the proposed model with the results achieved using the forecasting and inventory management modules of a popular ERP system. Tested with computer simulation, the proposed model significantly outperforms the commercial ERP model on both measures of service level and expected total annual cost.

AB  - What is Kaizen? Basically, Kaizen is a Japanese philosophy that means continual, incremental improvement. KAI = Change and ZEN = Good or for the better. This report is an illustration of how Kaizen can be used to remove MUDA (waste) from processes, in this case the process of inventory management. The rational that drives the necessity for MUDA removal is discussed as a precursor to the discussion of the Kaizen event. These include the idea of a lean enterprise, design for six sigma manufacturability (DSSM) and demand flow.

TI  - Light traffic heuristic for anM/G/1 queue with limited inventory
DO  - 10.1007/BF02060488
PY  - 1993///
AB  - Motivated by solving a stylized location problem, we develop a light traffic heuristic for anM/G/1 queue with limited inventory that gives rise to a closed form expression for average delay in terms of basic system parameters. Simulation experiments show that the heuristic works well. The inventory operates as follows: the inventory level drops by one unit after each service completion and whenever it drops to a pre-specified levelu, an order is placed with replenishment time ∼ exp(γ). Upon replenishment the inventory is restocked to a pre-specified levels and any arrivals when there is no inventory are placed in queue. Suggestions are given to cover the more general case of a New Better than Used (NBU) replenishment time distribution. Applications to inventory management problems are also discussed.

AB  - Market equilibrium dynamics of herd inventory management are derived for homogenous female populations. Short-run supply is backward bending in response to permanent changes in demand and is rising in response to transitory changes in demand. Increasing inventories are associated with high and falling prices and decreasing inventories with low and rising prices, but there is no market instability in this. These unusual intertemporal substitution effects follow from both rational expectations and appropriately formulated cobweb models and go part of the way toward explaining hog and cattle inventory cycles.

AB  - This study examined the factor structure and psychometric properties of the 38-item Team Climate Inventory and the 14-item short version using a sample of 72 four-person teams of management undergraduates in a Canadian university. The confirmatory factor analyses supported the five-factor correlated model that questions the validity of the original four-factor model. The confirmatory factor analyses also supported the short version. Team Climate Inventory scale and subscale scores showed no significant differences when the Team Climate Inventory was administered at two times, separated by 9 weeks, during the team projects. The Team Climate Inventory shows promise as a multidimensional measure of the team climate construct in both student and employee teams. Finally, the short version provides a useful measure when administration time is limited.

TI  - The value of timber inventory information for management planning
DO  - 10.1139/X08-075
PY  - 2008///
AB  - Timber inventory data is the basis for many monetary transactions related to timber and timberland sale and (or) purchase as well as for development of timber management plans. The value of such data is well known and much ap- preciated for sale and (or) purchase of standing merchantable timber. Unfortunately, the value of timber inventory data for planning purposes is less well understood. We report on the results of a large simulation study that was undertaken to eval- uate the utility and value of timber inventory data for timber management plan development for a typical timberland own- ership in the southern United States. Our results indicate that timberland managers are likely producing management plans that do not maximize the profitability of their timberland holdings. Specifically, our results indicate it is likely that timber management organizations that develop timber management plans with stand level data that has a sampling error of 25% are experiencing expected losses in net present value in excess of 170 US$� ha -1 on a large proportion of the acreage found on typical timberland parcels in the southern United States.

DO  - 10.1080/02827589809382981
PY  - 1998///
AB  - Forest management planning aims at fulfilling the goals of the forest owner. Scheduling treatments of forest stands, both in time and space, have been well investigated previously. Usually, however, these studies have assumed spatially discrete stands, representing imagined treatment units. Furthermore, the stands have been inventoried using ocular methods with varying and unknown precision. As an alternative to this conventional way of describing the forest, an objective circular plot inventory method was used, in the present investigation, to represent the forest on a 400 ha estate. Kriging was used to estimate spatially continuous forest characteristics from the georeferenced inventory plots. Spatial discontinuity, for example, between young and old forests, was handled by making an initial stratification of the forest into age‐classes. This approach enabled several spatially continuous variables, of interest to forest management planning, to be estimated at all locations. The stratification made it po...

PY  - 1996///
AB  - Campbell Soup’s Continuous Replenishment (CR) program is a novel innovation designed to improve the e¢ciency of inventory management throughout the supply chain. With CR: (1) retailers pay a constant wholesale price but continue to participate in consumer promotions; (2) retailers transmit to the supplier daily inventory information, via Electronic Data Interchange (EDI); and (3) the supplier assumes responsibility for managing retailer inventories, i.e. vendor managed inventories (VMI). We develop simple inventory management rules to operate CR, and we test these rules with a simulation using actual demand data provided by Campbell Soup. On this sample we ...nd that retailer inventories were reduced on average by 66% while maintaining or increasing average ...ll rates. This improvement reduces a retailer’s cost of goods sold by approximately 1:2%; which is signi...cant in the low pro...t margin grocery industry. Furthermore, these savings could have been achieved without VMI.

TI  - Patient-based pharmaceutical inventory management: a two-stage inventory and production model for perishable products with Markovian demand
DO  - 10.1057/hs.2012.2
PY  - 2012///
AB  - Drug shortages have increased over the past decade, tripling since 2006. Pharmacy material managers are challenged with developing inventory policies given changing demand, limited suppliers, and regulations affecting supply. Pharmaceutical inventory management and patient care are inextricably linked; suboptimal control impacts both patient treatment and the cost of care. We study a perishable inventory problem motivated by challenges in pharmaceutical management. Inpatient hospital pharmacies stock medications in two stages, raw material and finished good (e.g. intravenous). While both stages of material are perishable, the finished form is highly perishable. Pharmacy demand depends on the population and patient conditions. We use a stochastic ‘demand state’ as a surrogate for patient condition and develop a Markov decision process to determine optimal, state-dependent two-stage inventory and production policies. We define two ordering and production scenarios, prove the existence of optimal solutions for both scenarios, and apply this framework to the management of Meropenem.

The Forest Management Planning Package represents a general fundamental structure of a forest management planning system based on two inventory phases. It is an existing calculation system used in practical forestry in Sweden. The Forest Management Planning Package integrates economic theory, objective inventory measurements and accurate growth forecasts. The core of the system is a chain of models depicting the production possibilities of a forest holding. Detailed growth forecasts and economic calculations with high resolution (individual trees) permit analysis of various silvicultural treatment options in all types of Swedish stands. A non-linear objective function and mathematical optimization result in a compromise between maximum net present value and sustained net-revenue profile. Application of the system contributes to a much improved economic result through the removal of uncertainties concerning the real production possibilities and it has significantly altered the management strategies of the forest companies that have implemented it.

DO  - 10.1080/0020754031000065502
PY  - 2003///
AB  - Managing a distribution system requires the right inventory in the right place at the right time. A Theory of Constraints replenishment solution is presented to aggregate inventory buffers at the central warehouse in plant and change the mode of operation from push to pull. The solution is powerful, but the optimal amount of buffer remains undetermined. In Theory of Constraints, choosing a specific buffer size is not crucial if the buffer is accurately monitored in a timely manner. Accordingly, Theory of Constraints is offered a buffer management approach for monitoring the buffer. Such buffer management is feasible and effective but is insufficiently rigorous. This paper elucidates a generic buffer management procedure, based on the concept of Theory of Constraints buffer management that rigorously defines a method of monitoring to size and adjust the buffer. An example demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed generic buffer management procedure.

However, neither the marketing literature (shelf‐space allocation models) nor the operations management literature (inventory control models) has appropriately modeled this effect. The displayed‐inventory news‐vendor problem is developed and analyzed, utilizing a simple model to illustrate the interdependencies between the inventory and space‐allocation decisions. The model is then extended to the multi‐item case, which can be incorporated as part of a comprehensive shelf‐management system.

PY  - 2011///
AB  - The maintenance of a timely, reliable and accurate spatial database on current forest ecosystem conditions and changes is essential to characterize and assess forest resources and support sustainable forest management. Information for such a database can be obtained only through a continuous forest inventory. The National Forest Continuous Inventory (NFCI) is the first level of China’s three-tiered inventory system. The NFCI is administered by the State Forestry Administration; data are acquired by five inventory institutions around the country. Several important components of the database include land type, forest classification and ageclass/ age-group. The NFCI database in China is constructed based on 5-year inventory periods, resulting in some of the data not being timely when reports are issued. To address this problem, a forest growth simulation model has been developed to update the database for years between the periodic inventories. In order to aid in forest plan design and management, a three-dimensional virtual reality system of forest landscapes for selected units in the database (compartment or sub-compartment) has also been developed based on Virtual Reality Modeling Language. In addition, a transparent internet publishing system for a spatial database based on open source WebGIS (UMN Map Server) has been designed and utilized to enhance public understanding and encourage free participation of interested parties in the development, implementation, and planning of sustainable forest management.

AB  - The optimal design of a supply chain was approached in two phases by using: (1) a mathematical programming formulation and heuristic solution approach to minimize the distinct number of product types held at various points in the supply chain; and (2) a spreadsheet inventory model to estimate the safety stock needed to absorb random fluctuations in both demand and lead time throughout the system. This two-phased approach allowed management to quantify the effects of inventory required for locating parts of the supply chain in different geographic areas. The quantification of projected inventory requirements was a critical input used by senior management to clarify their final decision-making process.

AB  - We consider a continuous-time model for inventory management with Markov modulated non-stationary demands. We introduce active learning by assuming that the state of the world is unobserved and must be inferred by the manager. We also assume that demands are observed only when they are completely met. We first derive the explicit filtering equations and pass to an equivalent fully observed impulse control problem in terms of the sufficient statistics, the a posteriori probability process and the current inventory level. We then solve this equivalent formulation and directly characterize an optimal inventory policy. We also describe a computational procedure to calculate the value function and the optimal policy and present two numerical illustrations.

DO  - 10.1287/opre.1090.0706
PY  - 2010///
AB  - We study single and multistage inventory systems with stochastic lead times. We study a class of stochastic lead time processes, which we refer to as exogenous lead times. This class of lead time processes includes as special cases all lead time models from existing literature (such as Kaplan's lead times with no order crossing or independent and identically distributed lead times with order crossing, among others) but is a substantially broader class. For a system with an exogenous lead time process, we provide a method to determine base-stock levels and to compute the cost of a given base-stock policy. The method relies on relating the cost of a base-stock policy to the cost of a threshold policy in a related single-unit, single-customer problem. This single-unit method is exact for single-stage systems and for multistage systems under certain conditions. If the conditions are not satisfied, the method obtains near-optimal base-stock levels and accurate approximations of cost for multistage systems.

PY  - 2000///
AB  - ABSTRACT Evaluation of alternate strategies for municipal solid waste (MSW) management requires models to calculate environmental emissions as a function of both waste quantity and composition. A methodology to calculate waste component-specific emissions associated with MSW combustion is presented here. The methodology considers emissions at a combustion facility as well as those avoided at an electrical energy facility because of energy recovered from waste combustion. Emission factors, in units of kg pollutant per metric ton MSW entering the combustion facility, are calculated for CO2-biomass, CO2-fossil, SOx , HCl, NOx , dioxins/furans, PM, CO, and 11 metals. Water emissions associated with electrical energy offsets are also considered. Reductions in environmental emissions for a 500-metric-ton-per-day combustion facility that recovers energy are calculated.

AB  - The just-in-time management philosophy has traditionally been considered applicable only to large manufacturing firms. An examination of over 100 manufacturing firms, large and small, reveals that JIT is just as applicable to small firms as to large. Almost all elements traditionally implemented in house or regarding vendors are equally adaptable to both size firms. The use of outside consultants seems more prevalent in large firms. Small manufacturing firms actually managed greater percentage lot-size reductions from suppliers, greater reductions in inventory, and increased inventory turns.

TI  - On the Hotel Overbooking Problem---An Inventory System with Stochastic Cancellations
DO  - 10.1287/MNSC.24.11.1117
PY  - 1978///
AB  - M hotel rooms are available at a date n periods from now. Reservations are made by customers for that date, which is at the peak of the high season. Typically, for such a time period, a policy of overbooking is exercised by the hotel management. Customers, however, may cancel their previously confirmed reservations at any time prior to their arrival, with no penalty. On the other hand, new requests for rooms for that particular date are generated anew. At the end of each period the hotel management reviews both the “inventory” level of remaining uncanceled previously confirmed reservations and the total number of not-yet-confirmed new requests. At that time a decision is made regarding the inventory level of confirmed reservations with which to start the next period. A decision is one of three actions: i to keep the inventory at its present level i.e., declining all new requests; ii to increase the level of overbooking by confirming some of the new requests and, if necessary, by trying to obtain some additional reservations at some extra cost; iii to decrease the level of inventory by canceling some of the previously confirmed reservations incurring a penalty for each such cancellation. Each occupied room at the target day carries a given profit, while each unhonored reservation at that time incurs a penalty. The problem is to find the optimal over-booking strategy that will maximize net profit. For both criteria, maximization of the expected total net profit, and maximization of the expected discounted net profit, it is shown that the optimal strategy is a 3-region policy as follows: For each period there exist upper and lower bounds and an intermediate point such that, a if the overbooking level at the end of a period is greater than the upper bound, it should be decreased to that bound; b if the inventory level is below the lower bound, two cases may occur: i if the discrepancy is greater than the number of new requests, all new requests should be confirmed and additional reservations should be acquired such that the inventory level will be equal to the lower bound; and ii if the discrepancy is smaller than the number of new requests, some of the new requests are confirmed but the inventory level may not exceed the intermediate point; c if the inventory level is between the two bounds there are two possibilities: i if it is above the intermediate point none of the new requests are confirmed, but ii if it is below that point, some of the new requests should be confirmed provided that the new inventory level will not exceed the intermediate point.

This paper presents findings of a study that continued efforts to refine the Attitudes and Beliefs on Classroom Control (ABCC) Inventory. Formerly called the Inventory of Classroom Management Style, the ABCC is an instrument designed to measure teachers' perceptions of their classroom-management beliefs and practices. The study sought to investigate differences between the classroom-management style of male and female educators. A second objective was to substantiate the construct validity of the ABCC Inventory. The ABCC and selected subscales of the 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire (16 PF) were administered to 282 teachers in the southwestern United States. Twenty-two percent of the teachers taught at the elementary level and 61 percent taught at the secondary level. Females accounted for about two-thirds of the subject pool. Male teachers scored significantly higher in the interventionist style on two of the three ABCC subscales and significantly higher on "dominance" on the 16 PF. Several correlations with ABCC subscales and selected 16 PF subscales proved significant, were both positive and negative in direction, and were consistent with the construct.

TI  - Inventory Management in Pharmacy Practice: A Review of Literature
PY  - 2011///
AB  - In pharmacy operations, inventory is referred to as the stock of pharmaceutical products retained to meet future demand. Inventory represents the largest asset in pharmacy practice, and its value continues to rise because of the growth in variety and cost of pharmaceutical products. From both financial and operational perspectives, efficient inventory management plays a great role in pharmacy practice. Inventory management aims at reducing procurement and carrying costs, while maintaining an effective stock of products to satisfy customer and prescriber demands. The author reviews methods of inventory management in pharmacy practice, and highlights approaches by which the process of inventory management is evaluated. Factors affecting inventory management, including the role of information technology, are summarized. The author outlines, with recommendations, the impact of inventory mismanagement on patient safety.

TI  - Managing Supply Critical to Patient Care: An Introduction to Hospital Inventory Management for Pharmaceuticals
DO  - 10.1007/978-1-4614-5885-2_17
PY  - 2013///
AB  - Hospital operations and patient care are inextricably linked to the supply chain. Like buyers in other industries, pharmacy material managers are challenged to develop inventory policies in light of changing demand, limited suppliers, manufacturing issues, and regulatory rulings that affect drug supply. While these challenges are similar to those in many industries, the impact of drug shortages is quite different as they can have detrimental impacts to patient care and the cost of care. This chapter addresses the inventory management of supplies that directly impact patient care with a focus on pharmaceuticals. The chapter discusses the unique modeling challenges associated with inventory decisions for these products such as their multi-echelon nature, the potential for perishability and/or obsolescence, and internal production/preparation lead times. The chapter also explores the broader implications of the impact of demand uncertainty and inventory management strategies on hospital operations and cost with a particular focus on the comparison between stationary and nonstationary demand. Finally, future research opportunities are discussed.

DO  - 10.1108/01443570610682607
PY  - 2006///
AB  - Purpose – This paper sets out to discuss practical inventory control systems. Orthodox theory revolves around the purchaser and balances ordering costs against charges for carrying goods in stock. However, for any company holding thousands of different items the directives for constructing the best system(s) are confusing and the logic seems inconsistent. The research objective is to clarify this hitherto unsatisfactory situation and to provide robust guidelines for managing such inventories.Design/methodology/approach – A small number of published examples are described in sufficient detail to reveal what these firms actually do. Each case is dissected to uncover management's motives, since the original reports were not embellished with useful analytical comments. The aim is to reconstruct the overall design process.Findings – The myopic standpoint of established models neglects the impact of various ordering policies at the supplier's end, where the promotion of cost‐effective and responsive warehouse a...

DO  - 10.1080/09537280802420571
PY  - 2008///
AB  - This article considers the inventory management problem in a supply chain with uncertain replenishment lead-times and uncertain demands. The optimal integrated inventory management (IIM) policy is developed using stochastic dynamic programming theory. The IIM policy is contrasted with two pull-type vendor-managed inventory policies (VMI-1 and VMI-2) and a traditional retailer-managed inventory policy (RMI). Computational results show that in such stochastic supply chains, IIM performs about 23, 15, and 3% better than the optimised RMI, VMI-1 and VMI-2 policies, respectively, while two VMI policies are about 8 and 20% better than the best RMI. The basestock-based VMI-2 is a very good form of VMI. The ANOVA analysis reveals that the replenishment lead-times have the largest effect on the relative performance between IIM and other policies. Numerical examples demonstrated that the IIM policy has good structural properties and can be characterised by a set of switching curves.

AB  - Effectiveness of inventory management is a vital part in the manufacturing organization to be more competitive. The previous studies have indicated that there are several factors influencing the effectiveness of inventory management in the organization but there is lack of researchers who carried out the research in the manufacturing small medium enterprise in Johor. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to identify the problem of inventory management faced by the manufacturing small medium enterprise and also to determine the factors that will influence the effectiveness of inventory management. In completing this research, 80 employees were selected randomly from the manufacturing small medium enterprise in Batu Pahat, Johor and they were requested to complete questionnaires. The result have shown that the problems of inventory management faced by manufacturing organization were underproduction, overproduction, stock out situation, delays in the delivery of raw materials and discrepancy of records. The factors, documentation/store records, planning, knowledge of employees/staff skill have shown to significantly influence the effectiveness of inventory management while the funds have shown slightly significant influence on the inventory management in manufacturing small medium enterprises. This quantitative study is important to the manufacturing organization in Malaysia because it provides the guidelines to the employers of manufacturing small medium enterprises in Batu Pahat, Johor.

TI  - The Effect of RFID On Inventory Management and Control
DO  - 10.1007/978-1-84628-607-0_4
PY  - 2007///
AB  - Our thesis is that the evolution of information technology (IT) facilitates the flow of information, which in turn may reduce the variance of an inventory system, and hence its cost. We use radio-frequency identification (RFID) as a paradigm. RFID is the latest application of IT to tracking goods and services or anything for that matter, including human beings. It is an evolution from bar code and palette technology, and, in this chapter, we present the argument that RFID is superior in reducing the mean and variance of inventory cycle times. As inventory cost is a function of these (among other variables, such as unit holding and shortage costs), we show that RFID reduces this cost. Also, because RFID leads to rapid transmission of data, it would help avoid excessive inventories and shortages, further reducing total inventory cost. We argue that RFID is superior to existing identification technologies according to mean-variance stochastic dominance. We discuss the ethical implications and the societal trade-offs inherent in RFID, as society must decide how much of its privacy it is willing to curtail in the pursuit of lower prices versus physical security.

AB  - Braglia and Zavanella [2003, Modeling an industrial strategy for inventory management in supply chains: the ‘consignment stock’ care, International Journal of Production Research, 41 (16), 3793–3808] proposed an analytic formulation of consignment stock (CS) policy and made a comparison with Hill [1999, The optimal production and shipment policy for a single-vendor, single-buyer integrated production-inventory problem. International Journal of Production Research, 37 (11), 2463–2473] model. Through dividing per unit holding cost into a financial and a storage one the present note extends their conclusion and shows whether the CS model offers lower costs depends on the comparative result of buyer's and vendor's storage costs.

TI  - Improving inventory management in the retail store: The effectiveness of RFID tagging across product categories
DO  - 10.1007/S12063-011-0049-3
PY  - 2011///
AB  - While there is a growing body of evidence that Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging can be effective in improving inventory management in the retail store, retailers have little guidance on best practices for implementation. One important unresolved issue is whether tagging is equally effective across different product categories, and if there is a way to predict which categories are better candidates for deployment. We conduct a field experiment comparing the improvement in inventory record accuracy before and after implementing RFID-enabled adjustments to the inventory management system. We find evidence that the effectiveness of RFID tagging is not homogenous for all products. Reductions in the percentage of stockouts ranged from 21% to 36%, depending on category. Categories that are most likely to see a decrease in stockouts, thanks to RFID, have a greater turnover, greater sales volume, greater product variety, lower item cost, and greater inventory density. We draw inferences for retail supply chains which are considering how best to allocate their resources in the most effective manner.

DO  - 10.1109/WSC.2000.899167
PY  - 2000///
AB  - The paper is framed to address the preliminary approach towards process oriented collaborative inventory management in supply chains, taking advantage of multi-agent technology in terms of modeling and simulation. Initially, a SCM support model is proposed as a foundation to combine the supply chain processes with the multi-agent system. In succession, a simple PC assembling case is investigated and simulated mainly to validate the SCM support model. As a result, the combination has the potential to make possible a real strategic competitive advantage for the entire supply chain and will enable new forms of business, namely, collaborative inventory management. Accordingly, a theoretical framework of collaborative inventory management is highlighted to refine and extend the SCM support model with the purpose of synchronizing decisions as well as actions.

PY  - 2005///
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a method for segment-based forest inventory and determine whether segment-level inventories can be used in forest management planning. The study area covered 76 ha located in two different aerial photographs in eastern Finland. The study area was segmented into 220 segments with the aid of aerial photographs and the segment-level forest characteristics were assessed in the field using relascope sample plots and a field computer which displayed the aerial photographs, segment borders and surveyor's location on the screen. The segment estimates were calculated as weighted averages of k nearest neighbours (kNN) for the segments and the sample plots. The estimates were tested with a cross-validation technique. The averages and the standard deviations of the spectral values of aerial images extracted for the segments and the sample plots were used in the kNN estimation. The relative root mean square error of the mean volume was 58.1% (bias –6.4%) at the segment level and 57.9% (bias –0.9%) at the sample plot level. The segment-based approach studied here needs further research and improvement before it can be applied to forest management planning.

TI  - Optimizing Inventory Using Genetic Algorithm for Efficient Supply Chain Management
DO  - 10.3844/JCSSP.2009.233.241
PY  - 2009///
AB  - Problem statement: Today, inventory management is considered to be an important field in Supply chain management. Once the efficient and effective management of inventory is carried out throughout the supply chain, service provided to the customer ultimately gets enhanced. Hence, to ensure minimal cost for the supply chain, the determination of the level of inventory to be held at various levels in a supply chain is unavoidable. Minimizing the total supply chain cost refers to the reduction of holding and shortage cost in the entire supply chain. Efficient inventory management is a complex process which entails the management of the inventory in the whole supply chain and getting the final solution as an optimal one. In other words, during the process of supply chain management, the stock level at each member of the supply chain should account to minimum total supply chain cost. The dynamic nature of the excess stock level and shortage level over all the periods is a serious issue when implementation was considered. In addition, consideration of multiple products leads to very complex inventory management process. The complexity of the problem increases when more distribution centers and agents were involved. Approach: In present research, the issues of inventory management had been focused and a novel approach based on genetic algorithm had been proposed in which the most probable excess stock level and shortage level required for inventory optimization in the supply chain is distinctively determined so as to achieve minimum total supply chain cost. Results: The analysis provided us with an inventory level that made a remarkable contribution towards the increase of supply chain cost. We predicted the optimal inventory levels in all the supply chain members with the aid of these levels. Conclusion: We concluded that it is possible to minimize the supply chain cost by maintaining the optimal stock levels that we predicted from the inventory analysis. This will make the inventory management further effective and efficient thereby enhancing the customer servicing levels.

DO  - 10.1034/J.1399-3070.2000.00159.X
PY  - 2000///
AB  - Solid waste management needs to be environmentally sustainable to reduce overall environmental burdens. It also needs to be economically sustainable to be affordable for all sectors of the community served. Integrated waste management (IWM) takes an overall approach to this, involves the use of a range of different treatment options and deals with the entire waste stream. The tool of Life Cycle Inventory (the goal definition and inventory stages of a Life Cycle Assessment) can successfully be applied to integrated waste management systems to assess their environmental burdens. Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) tools for solid waste management have been available for some time. Several models have been developed and applied to both theoretical and actual waste management strategies. This report reviews a case study where a Life Cycle Inventory model was applied in the development of an integrated approach to waste management.

AB  - Kenneth J. Arrow (born August 23, 1921) earned a Bachelor’s degree from City College of New York in 1940, and a Master’s degree in 1941 and Ph.D. in 1951 from Columbia University. He has had academic positions at University of Chicago, Stanford, and Harvard, and numerous visiting positions at such institutions as University of California at Berkeley, M.I.T., Churchill College (Cambridge, UK), Institute for Advanced Studies (Vienna), University of Siena (Italy), and All Souls College (Oxford, UK). He is currently Joan Kenney Professor of Economics Emeritus and Professor of Operations Research Emeritus at Stanford University. He has made fundamental contributions to social choice theory, notably “Arrow’s impossibility theorem,” and to general equilibrium analysis. He has done foundational work in several areas of economics including endogenous growth theory and the economics of information. Closer to home for Production and Operations Management Society, Arrow has made seminal contributions in inventory theory, risk-aversion measures (notably the Arrow-Pratt measure of risk-aversion), concepts of moral hazard and adverse selection, mathematical programming, game theory, and optimal control theory. His classic 1951 Econometrica paper titled “Optimal Inventory Policy” (with T. Harris and J. Marschak) studies several important aspects of inventory theory including the newsvendor model and general dynamic inventory models. In the presence of fixed cost, they introduced the concept of the s S policy, which was proved to be optimal by H. Scarf in 1960. Arrow’s 1958 book Studies in the Mathematical Theory of Inventory and Production (Stanford University Press with S. Karlin and H. Scarf) is considered to be the bible in production inventory literature. In 1961, Arrow produced (with L. Hurwicz and H. Uzawa) a now well-known weak constraint qualification for obtaining the saddle-point characterization of a local solution to a nonlinear programming problem, and several famous results (with A. C. Enthoven) in characterizing optimization problems when both the maxim and and constraint functions are quasiconcave. He has used optimal control theory as a guide to resource allocation, inventory policy, public investment, etc. In a series of articles (with M. Kurz 1969, 1970), culminating in their 1970 book, Arrow presented numerous applications of the use of Hamiltonians and sufficiency optimality conditions. For works in these areas, he was awarded the 1986 John von Neumann Theory Prize. A part of the citation for the John von Neumann Theory Prize reads,

TI  - Unlocking the essentials of effective blood inventory management
DO  - 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01384.x
PY  - 2007///
AB  - T he classic blood supply chain (Fig. 1) travels from the donor through all aspects of processing, testing, and issue in the blood service to the hospital blood transfusion laboratory and ends with transfused patients. It is a chain because patient demand affects how many donors may be called. Shortages occur when supply does not meet demand, and in this situation the patient’s requirements for blood may be compromised, so it is important that blood supply chain management is effective and all parts of the chain work together to complement each other. It has been found that highly effective supply chains rely on three elements: time—timely provision of the product; transparency where all parts of the supply chain have visibility; and trust, which is derived from transparency. Having poor data management means leaving key decisions to chance. Access to key supply chain data are essential for our understanding of the blood supply chain, for improving blood inventory management practice, and for performance evaluations.

DO  - 10.1287/MNSC.43.9.1189
PY  - 1997///
AB  - Customer service has assumed strategic importance in most manufacturing environments. Corporate reputations often depend on how reliably promised lead times are met. A goal of filling orders within a service window of T time units is often encountered in practice. This goal ignores the differences among types of units, treating all customers as equally important. Keeping finished goods inventory of all items is only one, and often not the best, way to achieve this objective. High-demand items naturally have safety stock assigned to them, but in many organizations there are so many very-low-demand items that keeping any stock in these items is prohibitively expensive. Customer service can be maintained for these low-demand items by giving them higher production priority when a demand occurs. In this paper, stochastic analysis and simulation are employed to test the merit of this idea. Changes in management structure to allow this type of system are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The shelf life of platelet concentrates (PCs) is a matter of days. Simultaneously, the demand is highly variable, shortages are not allowed, and producing too many results in outdating. Concurrently, younger PCs, implying an extended time till outdating (TTO), are preferred. Common PC inventory management relies on experience‐based order‐up‐to rules. This study aimed at minimizing outdating and shortages, while extending the TTO through a theoretical approach. It focuses on PCs processed from whole blood donations.

PY  - 2016///
AB  - Fashion products have a short-life-cycle with highly volatile demand uncertainty. This uncertainty leads to challenges in managing inventory, as matching supply and demand is always difficult in the fashion industry. In this paper, we review the recent literature on fashion industry inventory management. We classify the extant literature by four widely-used research methodologies, including analytical, empirical, case study and simulation approaches. We identify that inventory ownership, information technology, and incentive schemes for increasing inventory efficiency are the key factors to enhance inventory management in the fashion industry. We propose that inventory management of luxury fashion, sustainability in inventory, and empirical and case study approaches are the most important directions for future research.

TI  - INVENTORY TURNOVER RATIO AS A SUPPLY CHAIN PERFORMANCE MEASURE
PY  - 2009///
AB  - Inventory management is vital in supply chain performance of a firm. The inventory turnover ratio measures the number of times a company sells its inventory during the year. A high inventory turnover ratio indicated how best the firm is operating economically in selling its products. Inventory turnover is a measure of management's ability to use resources effectively and efficiently. Precise control and safeguarding of inventory is an essential task for a successful and well organized company. Business requires timely and accurate information on inventory location, movement and valuation. ERP systems provide data pertaining to receipt of goods, movement within and between locations, the sale, removal or disposition of goods, lot and serial tracking, precise valuation and status of goods remaining in inventory at any point of time. As a part of its continuous improvement program (CIP), firms can focus on inventory turn ratio as a means of improving its supply chain performance. In this context, present research is aimed to measure effect of inventory turn over ratio on supply chain performance in a leading battery manufacturing organization in India.

TI  - A dynamic inventory system with recycling
DO  - 10.1002/NAV.3800270212
PY  - 1980///
AB  - This paper deals with a periodic review inventory system in which a constant proportion of stock issued to meet demand each period feeds back into the inventory after a fixed number of periods. Various applications of the model are discussed, including blood bank management and the control of reparable item inventories. We assume that on hand inventory is subject to proportional decay. Demands in successive periods are assumed to be independent identically distributed random variables. The functional equation defining an optimal policy is formulated and a myopic base stock approximation is developed. This myopic policy is shown to be optimal for the case where the feedback delay is equal to one period. Both cost and ordering decision comparisons for optimal and myopic policies are carried out numerically for a delay time of two periods over a wide range of input parameter values.

TI  - The Dutch foredunes: inventory and classification
PY  - 1994///
AB  - Aeolian transport of sand onto the foredunes is of importance with respect to the sediment budget of the coastal system. A classification of foredune types has been made, based on development, management and aeolian activity, using aerial photographs and a morphometric database. This classification provides insight into the occurrence and extent of natural processes in the foredunes, and will serve as a tool for calculation of a sediment budget. In only a few places along the Dutch coast, the foredunes are formed completely by natural processes: the majority are to some extent influenced by man. Although in many place aeolian processes are suppressed by man, their role in foredune development is important either in supply or in redistribution of sand. Geographical variation in aeolian processes results from a variation in management, vegetation, topography and effective wind climate.

TI  - Automation in drug inventory management saves personnel time and budget.
DO  - 10.1248/YAKUSHI.125.427
PY  - 2005///
AB  - Automation in the drug distribution processes is helpful to pharmacists in creating new clinical services. We have ameliorated the drug inventory control system seamlessly connected with the physician order-entry system. This control system application, named Artima, allows inventory functions to be faster and more efficient in real time. The medicines used in our hospital are automatically fixed and arranged to sold-packages, and are ordered from each wholesaler by a fax-modem every day. Artima can search the lot number and expiration date of drug in the purchase and delivery records. These functions are powerful and useful in patient's safety and cost containment. We surveyed the inventory amount stored in the computer database, and evaluated time required for inventory management by tabulating working records of employees during past decades. Inventory decreased by 70% along with the continuous improvement of the system during the past decade. The workload in the inventory management in each section of the Pharmacy Department as well as in clinical units was dramatically reduced after the implementation of this system. The automation system in the drug inventory management allows creating new clinical positions for pharmacists. This system also could pay for itself in time.

DO  - 10.2466/pr0.1982.50.1.31
PY  - 1982///
AB  - A reading of the manual for the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator left it unclear whether it measures, inter alia, level or style of creativity, whereas the Kirton Adaption-Innovation Inventory specifically purports to measure style but not level. Comparison of both manuals and instruments led the authors to the view that there were significant correspondences between the two tests. The present paper reports the results of the use of both Indicator and Inventory with a sample of experienced management students, yielding statistically significant moderate correlations between the Kirton Inventory and two of the four Myers-Briggs dimensions. It seems clear, therefore, that to the extent that the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator measures creativity, it is style rather than level that it is measuring.

PY  - 1999///
AB  - This paper describes the systems approach to the management of inventory. It puts into context the use of System Dynamics (SD) and other Cybernetic models and outlines their advantages and disadvantages. The main objective of a systems examination is to understand how the organisation of a business affects its performance. Principally the SD method is concerned with causal relationships. Cybernetic models are used to find an analytic expression to describe the whole process, concentrating on the input and outputs to the system. Results of simple inventory management are shown to be examples of proportional control in conventional theory. Better control algorithms, such as proportional, derivative and integral (PID), are used to indicate a more sophisticated form of inventory control that can easily reduce stock levels by 80% and hence reduce cost. This has special significance for JIT and MRP methods.

TI  - Accounting Methods and Management Decisions: The Case of Inventory Costing and Inventory Policy
DO  - 10.2307/2490341
PY  - 1980///
AB  - This study investigates whether associations consistent with LIFO-FIFO tax incentives exist between management choices to adopt or not adopt the LIFO inventory costing method and characteristics of firms' year-end inventories. Both pre- and postchoice characteristics are ex- amined. Because the LIFO-FIFO choice is voluntary, a postchoice association would be consistent with managers both anticipating future inventory characteristics when making a LIFO-FIFO choice and changing inventory management policies in response to that choice. Evidence consistent with the hypothesis that LIFO adoptions are associated with changes in inventory management policies would have important macroeconomic implications. Zarnowitz and Moore [1977] have argued that a failure to recognize the major shift in inventory costing methods which occurred in 1973 and 1974 (primarily FIFO to LIFO) resulted in an underestimation of inventory accumulations by the U.S. Department of Commerce. This underestimation resulted from the different procedures used under LIFO and FIFO to assign costs to inventory units. While this effect of LIFO-FIFO choices can bias macroeconomic measurements and forecasts, an associated change in inventory management policies by a large number of firms could directly affect underlying macroeconomic stocks and flows.

TI  - The Influence of Inventory Management Practices Towards Inventory Management Performance in Malaysian Public Hospitals
PY  - 2015///
AB  - Effective inventory management provides a potential system nowadays to improve performance by matching inventory management practices and competitive advantages in the competitive world. Logistics networks, supply chain activities and inventory management practices are seen as a matter of survival and competitive advantage for an organisation.Studied conducted in the area of inventory management practices revealed that improper management may have been caused by various reasons such as the level of management commitment, the costs incurred and also the level of skills that the workers have.Inventory management across the supply chain is a big challenge for improving coordination among the value chain in the organizations.Controlling inventory is the need of the hour as it formulates the future of the business in terms of its success/failure as competition is intense, growing day-by-day.This research conceptualizes and develops the role of inventory management practices in fostering inventory management performance.The relationships among different variables are proposed to be tested using the quantitative method. The insight from this proposed framework will help the respective Head of Pharmacists in the Malaysian public hospitals and other public or private inventory managers in implementing a proper system of inventory management practices to enhance the overall performance of inventory management.

DO  - 10.1109/AERO.2007.352918
PY  - 2006///
AB  - Prognostic techniques are intricately tied to the physics of incipient-fault-to-failure progression, and hence most prognostics research has focused on developing techniques for a range of components such as rotating machinery parts. The research and development of such techniques has relied on the theories of material science, structural mechanics, domain expertise, as well as empirical studies such as accelerated run-to-failure testing. Even after prognostic models have been developed and operationally validated for various components of a system, the challenge remains how prognostic assessments from individual components of a system (such as an aircraft engine) should be used to make maintenance and logistics decisions. In this paper, we describe an integration process where the primary focus is on bridging the gap between the individual component prognosis and the system-level reasoning required to support maintenance and inventory management decisions. The research involves integration of component health assessment with an information fusion mechanism that operates in conjunction with a higher-level reasoning engine which utilizes system-level structural and functional dependencies. The higher-level reasoning engine generates a system availability analysis that leads directly to actionable tasks for the inventory and maintenance management decision support systems. The inventory management decision support system involves predicting the spares requirements, and when this is integrated with remote health monitoring and intelligent diagnostics and prognostics, it can assess different sparing allocation schemes, and maximize system availability within budget constraints.

AB  - In the past, companies hoping to impress customers on delivery responsiveness did so by allowing inventories to bloat. Today the costs of holding inventory, especially in high-technology markets, prohibit that behavior. Companies must now provide good service while maintaining low inventories. Thus, managers must carefully measure and manage their two conflicting objectives: service and inventory. The challenge is to improve customer delivery service and reduce inventories simultaneously. Such results can be achieved through thoughtful supply chain management.

AB  - Managing inventory levels in the aggregate is a common concern of senior management. A generalized formula (turnover curve) developed in previous research that mimics practical inventory control is used to audit inventory control performance of inventories in the aggregate and at multiple stocking points. The same turnover curve is used to estimate the impact of changing the inventory control procedures or to set new targets for inventory levels. It is a simple yet powerful tool for evaluating inventory managerial performance that can be developed from readily available company data. This research provides additional examples to further validate the practical usefulness of the turnover curve.

The model is a single-stage inventory system with the criterion of maximizing the value of the firm, namely the expected present value of dividends. In a linear-cost case, the model is a dynamic newsvendor, and there is an optimal base-stock inventory policy which does not depend on the firm’s capital structure. However, the optimal dividend and liquidity policy depends on the inventory decisions. Without making linearity assumptions, the optimal capital structure depends on all parameters. However, sucient conditions for the optimum to be all-debt or all-equity depend only on financial parameters. We also show that a base-stock policy, optimal or not, has the “smoothing eect” that the

TI  - Production Management Techniques: Push‐Pull Classification and Application Conditions
DO  - 10.1108/EB054818
PY  - 1988///
AB  - A unitary scheme which classifies certain subsystems, within production management, according to push and pull logics is proposed. The three subsystems described are: inventory management, manufacturing priority assignment and material picking and moving, and production planning. The classification proposed is a starting point for establishing application requirements. The characteristics of the production context, not the inherent logic, determine the choice of the most feasible techniques. Techniques with different logics can hence coexist in the same production system.

AB  - We study profit maximization in inventory control problems where demands are unknown. Neither probabilistic distributions nor sets are available to characterize the unknown demand parameters. Therefore, we adopt an online optimization perspective for our analysis. The usual competitive ratio is not well defined for the problems we analyze; consequently, we introduce a new worst-case metric that is suitable. We consider two inventory management frameworks: (1) perishable products with lost sales and (2) durable products with backlogged demand. We consider both finite and infinite planning horizons. We design best-possible online procurement strategies for all cases.

PY  - 2012///
AB  - Cost analysis plays a pivotal role in the management of pharmacy store. About one-third of the hospital budget is spent on purchasing materials and supplies including medicines. The pharmacy is one of the most extensively used therapeutic facilities of the hospital and one of the few areas where a large amount of money is spent on buying items. To explore the feasibility of alphabetical analysis where items are classified into A, B and C categories depending on their annual consumption value, in effective management of pharmacy store. A study suggested that review for expensive drugs could bring out 20% savings in pharmacy store budget. The goal of inventory management involves having to balance the conflicting economics of not wanting to hold too much stock. The inventory management can bring out significant improvement not only in patient care but also in the optimal use of resources. Continuous management can provide the value added services to the patients. Keyword: Drug Inventory Management, ABC Analysis, Pharmacy Store Budget.

DO  - 10.1007/978-3-540-24815-6_6
PY  - 2004///
AB  - Inventory management is playing a key role in setting up efficient closed loop supply chains. Companies are recognizing product returns as a critical supply source, which they need to integrate into their material management. Uncertainty and a limited span of control add to the complexity of managing this particular source. In this chapter we review inventory management issues related to closed loop supply chains. We start by discussing different roles of inventories in this context and by proposing an overall framework. Subsequently, we review literature on corresponding mathematical inventory control models. To this end, we follow a standard structuring of traditional inventory theory and discuss applications to closed loop settings for each case. Our analysis is centered around highlighting novel characteristics entailed by a closed loop supply chain structure, in terms of both mathematics and business implications.

AB  - Time and form postponement are key to the cost-effective fulfillment of product demand when market volatility is high. Using data from U.S. manufacturing firms, an empirical model suggests that the implementation of time postponement supports the adoption of form postponement. In turn, form postponement is linked to the improvement of inventory management performance. The model also shows that inventory management information systems are coupled with improvements in performance by facilitating a closer alignment between time and form postponement.

PY  - 2010///
AB  - Supply chain operations are widely used, as they have proven very effective in contemporary business environments. Traditional supply chain coordination has suffered from well-known bullwhip effects, which have been alleviated in part through greater information exchange from Efficient Consumer Response (ECR) and more coordinated systems such as Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI). The refinements of VMI include Continuous Replenishment (CR) and Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR). This paper reviews the definitions of these variant supply chain inventory management systems. Simulation studies of VMI have studied the expected impact on supply chain operations. This paper evaluates the relative benefits and costs of alternative supply chain inventory systems and provides an analysis of the conditions for which coordinated inventory management systems are appropriate.

PY  - 2004///
AB  - Essentially, inventory management concerns the process of deciding on 1) how often to review stocks, 2) when to replenish stocks, and 3) how much to replenish. This basic focus of inventory management persists in the presence of item returns that can be recovered and then used for servicing demand. However, the details and complexities with which the three basic decisions manifest themselves can, and usually do, differ greatly due to the presence of recoverable-item flows. This, and the practical relevance of inventory management with recoverables, warrants the development of inventory theory that explicitly includes flows of recoverable items.

Decisive efforts to meet the biodiversity crisis need not compromise advances in taxonomic theory and practice in the interest of expediency. Inventories provide data for understanding the origin and history of diversification of life on Earth, while gathering scientific evidence to inform decisions related to conservation and resource management.

PY  - 1974///
AB  - IN RECENT YEARS the literature has contained a great number of decision models for both accounts receivable and inventory management. However, almost all of these models suffer from the following defects: They ignore the interrelationship between demand and both inventory policy and accounts receivable policy. In addition, they ignore the dynamic aspects of an accounts receivable policy as well as the interrelationship between inventory and accounts receivable policies. Inventory models are generally developed independently of receivable models and do not reflect the cost trade-offs and interaction between the two services.' In a recent paper Damon and Schramm2 give an interactive model of finance, inventory and marketing policies. However, in their model the financial aspect relate to the choice of short-term borrowing and investment. Our paper also presents an interactive model of finance and inventory policies, however, its financial aspect relates to the problem of accounts receivable management. Managers, whether they are attempting to employ analytical models or not, are hindered from integrating accounts receivable policy and inventory policy by the organizational structure of the typical firm. Typically, inventory management is considered to be part of production management while credit management is generally the responsibility of the treasurer or the controller.3 Operationally, the demand for customer service and credit extension comes from the need to meet the objective of the marketing function, however specified or perceived but generally expressed as a given volume of sales, profits and/or

TI  - Validation of an Inventory of Classroom Management Style: Differences between Novice and Experienced Teachers.
PY  - 1993///
AB  - A preliminary investigation was conducted of the construct validity of the Inventory of Classroom Management Style (ICMS), a scale to measure differences in perceptions of classroom management style. The main objective was to determine if the scale reflects differences between novice and experienced teachers. Classroom management is defined as a multi-faceted construct including broad dimensions of person, instruction, and discipline. Data were collected from 158 college students (61 percent novice teachers still in college and 39 percent experienced teachers in a college class) via the ICMS, Rotter's Internal-External Locus of Control Scale, the 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire, and a demographics form. Beliefs were classified on a continuum from non-interventionist through interactionalist to interventionist. Several differences were found between novice and experienced teachers. Novices scored as significantly more interventionist than did experienced teachers. Experienced teachers were more internal regarding locus of control, but no significant relationship was found between ICMS scores and locus of control. Interventionists also tended to be more conservative and respecting of traditional ideas. Eleven tables present study findings. Three appendixes contain a framework for the ICMS dimensions, a teacher behavior continuum, and the ICMS instrument.

The primary goal of this study is to begin a preliminary investigation of construct validity of the Inventory of Classroom Management Style (ICMS), a scale to measure differences in perceptions of classroom management style. The learning-to-teach literature suggests that novice and experienced teachers have different approaches and beliefs regarding classroom management style. A main objective, therefore, was to determine if the scale reflects these differences between novice and experienced teachers. Within this study, classroom management is defined as a multi-faceted construct that includes three broad dimensions--person, instruction, and discipline. Data were collected from 158 subjects (61 % novice teachers, 39 % experienced teachers) via the Inventory of Classroom Management Style (ICMS), Rotter's I-E Locus of Control Scale, 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire (16 PF), and demographics. The ICMS represents a major revision of Tamashiro's Beliefs on Discipline Inventory, consists of 19 forced-choice items in its revised form, and considers each of the three dimensions of classroom management. Beliefs were classified on a continuum that reflects the degree of teacher power over students and categorizes beliefs into three segments--noninterventionist, interactionalist, and interventionist. Data were analyzed utilizing a series of ANOVAs and correlations. Significant results were found regarding a variety of variables.

TI  - A Deterministic Multi-Period Production Planning Model with Piecewise Concave Production and Holding-Backorder Costs
DO  - 10.1287/MNSC.21.9.1007
PY  - 1975///
AB  - A single product, finite horizon production planning model with known requirements is considered. Production and holding-backorder cost functions are assumed to be piecewise concave, thereby allowing an arbitrarily close approximation to a wide range of cost functions which one might encounter in practice. In each period production, inventories and backlogged orders may not exceed prescribed levels. Production (inventory) breakpoints are the endpoints of the intervals over which the production (holding-backorder) cost functions are concave. It is shown that there is an optimal production schedule which has the property that between successive periods in which ending inventories are at inventory breakpoint levels there is at most one period in which production is not at a production breakpoint level. This property, which is an extension of recent results obtained by Florian and Klein [Florian, Michael, Morton Klein. 1971. Deterministic production planning with concave costs and capacity constraints. Management Sci. 18 (1, September) 12-20.] and Love [Love, Steven F. 1973. Bounded production and inventory models with piecewise concave costs. Management Sci. 20 (3, November) 313-318.], suggests a straight-forward dynamic programming algorithm for obtaining an optimal solution.

DO  - 10.1080/00207540500338039
PY  - 2006///
AB  - Differences in estimation or forecasting procedures could produce dramatically different parameter estimates in supply chain inventory management. We show, for example, that determining when to introduce estimates of lead times in the calculation of the variance of demand during lead time can yield dramatically different safety stocks and order-up-to levels. Also, calculations of supply chain variance amplification using a firewalled, sequential chain execution differ markedly from an analysis that considers a k-echelon analysis as a whole, k > 2. There is also the issue of forecasting lumpy demand when negative orders are not allowed. Our research compares the results in the recent literature and shows how apparently equivalent estimation procedures concerning demand during lead time (for example, using separate historical lead time and demand rate data versus directly using historical data of demand during lead time) are not equivalent; also, that the conventional exponential smoothing forecasting may not be appropriate at the higher echelons of supply chains where lumpy demand frequently occurs.

TI  - Inventory Management with Advanced Warning of Disruptions
PY  - 2005///
AB  - Strategies for managing the risk of supply disruptions include inventory, dual sourcing and contingency (i.e., emergency) sourcing. Tomlin (2005) investigates the optimal mix of these strategies when a supplier faces a constant probability of a disruption. In the constant failure rate case, inventory becomes an increasingly unattractive strategy as the probability of disruption decreases (holding the supplier uptime percentage constant) because inventory needs to be carried for longer durations between disruptions. In many situations, firms receive some warning that the likelihood of a disruption at a supplier has changed. Such warnings may come in the form of feedback on the progress of labor negotiations, severe weather alerts, or the Department of Homeland Security’s terror alert level. We investigate how the presence of such warnings alters the optimal inventory policy, and therefore the optimal disruption-management strategy. We assume that the firm periodically determines its “threat level,” i.e., its estimate of the probability of a supply disruption. The firm can react by adjusting its inventory levels to provide an appropriate level of protection against an impending disruption. Previous models for inventory management under the threat of disruptions have assumed that the firm maintains a constant inventory-level target regardless of the threat level; the advantage of our approach is that inventory levels may remain low when the risk is low and increase only when the risk is heightened. In this extended abstract, we focus on a special case in which demand is deterministic, the supplier has infinite capacity, and excess inventory may be returned to the supplier at no cost. These assumptions enable closed form solutions to the inventory optimization

AB  - The management of inventories and determination of transportation policy are normally carried out by different groups of people in an organization. These activities interact, however, when the transportation is used to replace inventory and when the transportation alternatives have different speed, reliability, and cost characteristics. This paper presents exact and heuristic procedures for jointly determining the inventory reorder points, order quantities, and transportation alternatives that provide minimum total transportation and inventory costs. The effectiveness of each procedure is demonstrated for a broad range of problems. The heuristic procedure was also applied to actual company data to determine the potential for cost savings. The results showed that savings were possible both from improving the current procedures and from applying the procedure developed in this study.

TI  - Inventory Management using Passive RFID Tags : A Survey
PY  - 2002///
AB  - Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems have emerged as an affordable solution for object identification. They are a cheap and error proof alternative to traditional object identification techniques such as bar codes and visual recognition. The problem is to identify objects attached with passive tags. If there are multiple objects within the range of the tag reader, then all objects send their identification to the tag reader at the same time in response to the tag reader’s query. This causes collisions at the tag reader and no tag is identified, leading to retransmission of tag IDs which results in wastage of bandwidth and an increase in the total delay in identifying all the objects. Hence protocols need to be devised between the tags and the tag reader to avoid or minimize collisions. Typical collision resolution protocols for a generic multi-access communication system cannot be directly applied to our problem due to constraints on the design of the tag such as lack of battery, low memory, minimum computation power, etc. The main focus of this paper is to discuss collision resolution protocols between the tag and the tag reader. We have surveyed four protocols for the above problem and discussed their merits and demerits. We also explain the applicability of each of the protocols to a scenario where objects need to be identified and updated in an inventory management system.

AB  - Recent years have seen an increase of interest in the field of service parts inventory - particularly in computer industry. The computer industry is a highly competitive industry; products have to be repaired as quickly as possible, since slow repair can lead to loss of future business to competitors with better service reputations. A good reputation is therefore closely linked to the availability of spare parts on the market. Given this fact and using a real-life case study, this paper first elaborates on the management and control of service-parts inventory and presents a brief overview of the contemporary literature on the subject. Next the paper presents the solution approach adopted and the results of study, which indicate that significant savings can be realized through good management of service-parts inventory.

TI  - Case Study–Based Evaluation of Stochastic Multicommodity Emergency Inventory Management Model
DO  - 10.3141/2283-02
PY  - 2012///
AB  - Emergency disaster management has emerged as a vital tool for reducing the harm and alleviating the suffering that disasters worldwide cause their victims. A significant task of planners involved in emergency disaster management is the ability to plan for and satisfy the vital needs of the people located in emergency shelters, such as the Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, which was used as a shelter during Hurricane Katrina. This task requires determination of a way to reduce the uncertainties associated with emergency operations and to estimate the expected costs of delivery and consumption of vital supplies throughout these operations. This paper attempts to address these issues by application of a case study–based approach to demonstrate the usefulness of a stochastic humanitarian inventory control model and estimation of the minimum safety stock levels of emergency inventories. The emergency inventory management problem is discussed, and previous emergency inventory studies are reviewed to identify the need for a stochastic emergency inventory management model. After introduction of the mathematical formulation for the model, the formulation is applied to a number of realistic case studies built on the basis of the experiences in recent major disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina. The paper concludes with a summary of lessons learned for the model when it is applied to a wide range of scenarios drawn from real-life experiences and used to create emergency inventory management strategies for different types of disasters.

DO  - 10.1287/MNSC.25.8.709
PY  - 1979///
AB  - The marginal cost information needed to implement traditional inventory models is not likely to be available in practice. The most important inventory management issues in practive involve aggregate objectives and constraints while the richest theoretical models deal with single item management. To help resolve these problems, the authors propose that inventory decisions be conceived as policy tradeoffs on a three dimensional response surface showing the optimal relationships among aggregate customer service, workload, and investment. We show that any optimal management decision must result in a point located on the surface. Computational results show that the methodology suggested can make improvements in management policy in four inventories that total more than 78,000 line items.

PY  - 2000///
AB  - Companies that maintain web sites can make considerable revenue through advertising, and consequently attracting advertisers has become an important and competitive endeavor. A property that can attract advertisers is high clickthrough rates; and therefore companies can bene t from delivery systems that serve advertisements selectively to those visitors most likely to click. In order to satisfy contractual obligations, however, these systems must simultaneously perform inventory management. For example, if a company has agreed to serve a certain number of a particular advertisement, it must do so regardless of how likely it is to be clicked. In this paper, we describe how to use a linear program to identify a schedule, based on known attributes of each visitor, that maximizes the expected number of clicks given all of the inventory-management constraints. We present experimental results using real data that demonstrate that a delivery schedule from our system realizes more clicks than a schedule that was hand constructed.

TI  - Financial Management of Inventory
PY  - 1984///
AB  - FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF INVENTORY Modern inventory management methods have not, until recently, been widely used by small businesses, even though the concepts are not difficult to understand or apply. Nevertheless, because small firms normally do not enjoy the same degree of financial stability or operational efficiency as larger competitors, the asset categories in which large amounts of capital are invested (such as accounts receivable and inventory) must be well-managed in order to maximize returns on investments. Small firms are frequently subject to money constraints that prevent them from operating in the same way larger firms do. For example, small firms typically cannot hire experienced professionals to handle each major business function, and cannot afford the diversification of talent represented by a large staff, or the installation and implementation of sophisticated computer-assisted procedures. Many techniques which could solve small business problems cannot be implemented unless costs can be covered out of normal cash flow. Yet the primary goal of a business, at least according to financial theory, is the maximization of the value of the firm. Studies have show that this goal may be realistic for large (Fortune 500) firms, but it is probably not as real a goal for small-business owner/managers, who tend of necessity to focus on day-to-day problems in order to maintain a positive cash flow and bank balance, whic in turn provide a satisfactory return to the owner for the effort and risk involved in the conduct of a business. Most small business are not incorporated (and if they are, their stock is not marketable), therefore, few owners actually make decisions based on effects on share prices or earnings per share. Rather, the emphasis is on profit and cash flow. Most small businesses strive to compete and survive against large competitors in a dynamic economy. Because of the large investment a typical business msut make in inventory, the proper management of this asset can have a significant effect on the profitability of the firm. More efficient management of this account alone can enhance the firm's profits and profit margin. The results of a survey of small business inventory management practices are presented in this article and compared with techniques commonly employed by large corporations. (Small businesses are defined for the purpose of this study as firms with annual sales under $10 million.) DESCRIPTION OF SAMPLE Data for this study were collected by means of a mail questionnaire distributed to three hundred randomly selected firms that were identified from the Yellow Pages in the telephone directories of the greater Norfolk-Portsmouth, and the Hampton-Newport News, Virginia, SMSAs. The firms were selected in five different distribution levels, with annual sales varying from under $50,000 up to $10 million. The firms employed up to three hundred persons, although more than 46 percent had less than ten employees. Of the three hundred businesses selected for the study, ninety-four, or 31 percent, responded. A breakdown fo the respondent firms by industry and size is given in table 1. THE COMPROMISE Previous studies of inventory control techniques have focused on Fortune 500-size firms, which tend to use sophisticated mathematical and statistically-based methods. However, even in large firms, the use of financially integrated inventory control methods is rather recent. One of the reasons for this is the split responsibility of the finance and production/inventory functions. The firm's financial managers concentrate on the allocation and efficient management of funds in various inventory categories (e.g., raw material, work-in-process, and finished goods), whereas production and inventory managers tend to be interested in the more efficient production of various finished goods items, with special attention given to employee production schedules, long production runs, and storage of finished goods. …

TI  - Gradient modeling: A new approach to fire modeling and wilderness resource management
DO  - 10.1007/BF01867398
PY  - 1977///
AB  - Managers of wilderness resources must maintain, preserve, and sometimes restore pristine ecosystems while providing for public use and enjoyment of these areas. These managers require a resource information system that can store, retrieve and integrate basic data, synthesize components to solve particular problems, and provide simulations and predictions of natural processes and management actions. Traditional information systems based on land classification and type-mapping do not provide these capabilities.Gradient modeling, a new approach to resource management and forest fire simulation, has been developed to meet these needs in Glacier National Park. The method links four major components: (1) a terrestrial site inventory coded from aerial photographs that offers 10-m resolution; (2) gradient models of vegetation and fuel that derive quantitative stand compositional data from the parameters stored in the coded inventory; (3) a fuel moisture and microclimate model that extrapolates basestation weather data to remote sites using the parameters stored in the inventory; and (4) fire behavior and fire ecology models that integrate the data from the inventory and models to calculate real-time fire behavior and ecological succession following a fire.

TI  - Semiconductor inventory management with multiple grade parts and downgrading
DO  - 10.1080/09537280600901152
PY  - 2006///
AB  - In semiconductor manufacturing, product performance can vary from the intended design specifications. When we add long manufacturing lead times, high demand uncertainty and short product life cycles, finding efficient supply and demand planning becomes a challenging task. This paper is concerned with inventory management of a semiconductor production system that results in multiple grade parts. Downward substitution (i.e. downgrading high grade products) is used to satisfy unmet demand for lower grade parts. We model this problem as an inventory cost minimization problem with service constraints and introduce the notion of a critical part to propose two heuristics for determining near optimal build quantities in key stages of manufacturing. We show that a single period allocation scheme does not result in inventory performance deterioration in the multi-period stationary case. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology by running extensive numerical experiments.

AB  - As part of the customer relationship management (CRM) strategy, many researchers have been analyzing ‘why’ customers decide to switch. However, despite its practical relevance, few studies have investigated how companies can react to defection prone customers by offering the right set of products. Consumer insight has been captured in the work, but not used for inventory replenishment. In the present research paper, a data mining model has been proposed which can be used for multi-item inventory management in retail sale stores. The model has been illustrated with an example database.

PY  - 2000///
AB  - This paper is framed to address the preliminary approach towards process-oriented collaborative inventory management in supply chains, taking advantage of multiagent technology in terms of modeling and simulation. Initially, a SCM support model is proposed as a foundation to combine the supply chain processes with the multi-agent system. In succession, a simple PC assembling case is investigated and simulated mainly to validate the SCM support model. As a result, the combination has the potential to make possible a real strategic competitive advantage for the entire supply chain and will enable new forms of business, namely, collaborative inventory management. Accordingly, a theoretical framework of collaborative inventory management is highlighted to refine and extend the SCM support model with the purpose to synchronize decisions as well as actions.

TI  - Hospital Inventory Management for Emergency Demand
DO  - 10.1111/J.1745-493X.1993.TB00016.X
PY  - 1993///
AB  - Inventory management is receiving increased emphasis in a variety of organizations, including manufacturing firms and service sector firms. One particularly significant area is the procurement and management of inventories in organizations subject to emergency demand situations. As materials managers and buyers work to increase the efficiency of the materials system, and to decrease inventory levels, their efforts are countered by the suggestion that these inventories are needed to meet emergency situations in which demand may triple over night. This study was conducted to explore the validity of some of the more common assumptions about the management of emergency inventories. One of the most challenging areas where emergency inventories have to be managed is in a hospital. This study dealt with the management of inventories in a hospital, with a focus on the handling of emergency demand requirements. With increasing costs and a nationalized health care system looming on the horizon, the role of the materials manager is increasingly important to a hospital's cost effectiveness. Hospital inventory has been reported to run from 16 to 28 percent of the hospital budget. Further, for every dollar spent on supplies, seventy cents is spent for distribution to the point of use.|1~ Starting an inventory reduction program requires that management first address the fears and assumptions of hospital personnel. Inventory availability directly impacts their ability to provide quality patient care. In today's environment, however, the inventory cushion used in past years is no longer acceptable. Determining acceptable inventory levels becomes more complex as materials managers attempt to factor into inventory decisions the hospital's probability of experiencing large-scale emergency demand situations. Tornadoes, airplane crashes, floods, chemical spills, fires, earthquakes, and other similar events occur with little or no warning and may result in a sudden increase in the number of incoming patients for a hospital. In this author's view, however, inflated inventory levels designed for these emergencies should be questioned, given that each hospital faces a relatively low probability of experiencing such a situation. A materials manager's focus should be directed toward establishing efficient inventory system policies for normal operating conditions--and then to modify them to also ensure the hospital's ability to meet emergency (or shock) demand conditions. The model developed for this study was used to determine the relative significance of several common inventory system parameters on a hospital's ability to operate successfully under normal and shock conditions. HOSPITAL MATERIALS MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS Most hospital medical and surgical supply inventories operate as multi-echelon systems. The central stores operation services the inventory needs of the many lower level point-of-use (POU) locations throughout the hospital. Most orders are placed by central stores to the external suppliers. As orders are received, central stores performs the receiving operation. As in most organizations, there are some exceptions to this procedure. The surgical suite, for example, may place and receive orders directly with a surgical supplies supplier. Some hospitals have also developed selected stockless systems contracts, in which case the supplier acts as a central store and delivers directly to the POU location. This study, however, focuses on the more common relationship between central stores and point-of-use locations. Surprisingly, in most previous studies of hospital supply operations, the research focus has been on a single level of this multilevel environment, either central stores|2~ or point-of-use locations.|3~ Several different methods for managing medical and surgical supply inventories are used at the central stores level. Periodic review systems are the most common and are implemented as either a "reorder point-order quantity" system or a "reorder-up-to-point" system. …

DO  - 10.2307/2491381
PY  - 1995///
AB  - In this paper, we model the management control and motivational aspects of Just-in-Time (JIT) production systems. Firms that implement JIT systems attempt to reduce work-in-process (VWP) inventories. Traditional inventory models, which balance the lost productivity from stockouts against the costs of carrying buffer stocks of inventory, have had limited success in explaining the benefits of JIT systems, perhaps because such models focus solely on material costs. In contrast, it is commonly claimed that the benefits of a JIT system do not come solely from reducing inventory-carrying costs (e.g., see Barrier [1992, p. 30]). In particular, Arthur [1994] and MacDuffie [1995] provide evidence that JIT systems are often accompanied by changes in the firm's human resource management policies. We model a multi-input production setting which integrates features of "standard" inventory models and "standard" principal-agent models to focus on the interaction between inventory and incentive issues. Specifically, we analyze how motivational issues with workers affect the optimal

PY  - 2005///
AB  - Many argue that the focus point (and perhaps the linchpin) of successful supply chain management is inventories and inventory control. So how do food and agribusiness companies manage their inventories? What factors drive inventory costs? When might it make sense to keep larger inventories? Why were food companies quicker to pursue inventory reduction strategies than agribusiness firms? In 1992, some food manufacturers and grocers formed Efficient Consumer Response to shift their focus from controlling logistical costs to examining supply chains (King & Phumpiu, 1996). Customer service also became a key competitive differentiation point for companies focused on value creation for end consumers. In such an environment, firms hold inventory for two main reasons, to reduce costs and to improve customer service. The motivation for each differs as firms balance the problem of having too much inventory (which can lead to high costs) versus having too little inventory (which can lead to lost sales). A common perception and experience is that supply chain management leads to cost savings, largely through reductions in inventory. Inventory costs have fallen by about 60% since 1982, while transportation costs have fallen by 20% (Wilson, 2004). Such cost savings have led many to pursue inventory-reduction strategies in the supply chain. To develop the most effective logistical strategy, a firm must understand the nature of product demand, inventory costs, and supply chain capabilities. Firms use one of three general approaches to manage inventory. First, most retailers use an inventory control approach, monitoring inventory levels by item. Second, manufacturers are typically more concerned with production scheduling and use flow management to manage inventories. Third, a number of firms (for the most part those processing raw materials or in extractive industries) do not actively manage inventory. Many agribusiness firms do not actively manage inventory. This does not mean that they ignore inventory. Rather, they hold large inventories because any potential savings from inventory reductions are far outweighed by the inventory-induced reductions in production, procurement, or transportation costs. Often economies of size cause long productions runs which lead to inventory accumulation. Simultaneously, seasonality leads to inventory buildups of key inputs like seed as well as outputs like corn. Economies in procurement such as forward buying in the food industry and quantity discounts increase inventories. Similarly, unit trains and other forms of bulk shipping discounts contribute to inventory buildups. Yet, such firms must be alert to changing conditions that may require more exact inventory management. One example would be if crops are marketed as small lots of value-added grain instead of commodities. Production proliferation in the seed industry may be another instance. Finally, whether due to food safety concerns, GMOs, food labeling, or the growth of organic food markets, identity preservation requires more precise inventory control.

AB  - The concept of taxonomy is applied to inventory management in a supply‐chain using the example of the US textile industry. Through classification and standardisation of issues related to inventory management problems, it is shown how inventory models and techniques can be generalised across diverse application environments represented by autonomous business entities that form the supply‐chain. Three generic models that implement inventory decision rules to address constant (or level), time varying (or chase), and mixed demand patterns associated with stock keeping unit (SKU) categories are proposed. Applications of these inventory models to a textile supply‐chain are discussed.

DO  - 10.1007/BF02472011
PY  - 1995///
AB  - The National Forest Management Act (1976) specifies that multiresource inventories be conducted to provide baseline data for development and, later, monitoring of national forest management plans. This mandate entails the most ambitious and complex resource planning effort ever attempted. In this paper we evaluate the structure and use of current inventory-monitoring programs and recommend a framework for gathering data to improve national forest planning. Current national guidelines are general and provide only basic directions to forest-level planners. Forest inventories have traditionally concentrated on timber. Although these inventories are often well designed, the questions we are now asking about forest resources have outgrown these methods. Forest management is impeded by general confusion over definitions of resources and the interactions among them. We outline a simple classification scheme that centers on identification of basic ecosystem elements that can be readily measured. Furthermore, spatial and temporal scales must be considered in the design of inventory-monitoring programs. The concept of ecological indicators is reviewed, and caution is advised in their use. Inventory-monitoring programs should be goal-directed and based on as rigorous a statistical design as possible. We also review fundamental issues of variable selection, validation, and sampling bias. We conclude by developing a flexible inventory-monitoring program that is designed to provide information on individual characteristics of the environment, rather than being based on fixed definitions of resources.

Specifically, two benchmark problems of relevance to semiconductor manufacturing are examined. The first one is a single product, two node problem consisting of a fab/sort and an assembly/test facility controlled with a predictive controller using anticipation. The performance of the control scheme under conditions of plant-model mismatch, and unforeseen demand are evaluated. The insights gained from this problem are used in the design of a centralized MPC controller for a four node problem involving two interconnected fab/sort and assembly/test facilities. In this latter problem, inventory management of wafer, die, and package inventories are considered.

TI  - INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL BUDGETING: A PEDAGOGICAL NOTE
DO  - 10.1111/J.1540-5915.1975.TB01029.X
PY  - 1975///
AB  - This paper shows, through an alternative development of the lot size model, how the methods of capital budgeting can be logically applied to the determination of optimal inventory levels. There is no reason why inventory management needs be treated any differently than the management of fixed assets. The rule that the stock of fixed assets should be expanded until the marginal rate of return equals the marginal cost of capital results from maximizing the present value of profits as a function of the investment level. In a like manner, the “square root” formula from inventory theory results from maximizing the present value of profits as a function of the investment in inventory. In addition, formulating the inventory problem as a capital budgeting problem has advantages for incorporating deterioration, obsolescence, and other costs into the model in a more logical and less intuitive way.

TI  - Forecasting demand and inventory management using Bayesian time series
DO  - 10.1108/09576060010335609
PY  - 2000///
AB  - Discusses the development and evaluation of a forecasting model for inventory management in an advanced technology batch production environment. Traditional forecasting and inventory management do not adequately address issues relating to a short life cycle and to non‐seasonal products with a relatively long lead time. Limited historical data (fewer than 100 observations) is also a problem in predicting short‐term dynamic or unstable time series. A Bayesian dynamic linear time series model is proposed as an alternative technique for forecasting demand in a dynamically changing environment. Provides details of the important characteristics and development process of the forecasting model. A case study is then presented to illustrate the application of the model based on data from a multinational company in Singapore. It also compares the Bayesian dynamic linear time series model with a classical forecasting model (auto‐regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model).

TI  - Designing Ordering and Inventory Management Methodologies for Purchased Parts
DO  - 10.1111/J.1745-493X.2002.TB00126.X
PY  - 2002///
AB  - This article presents a method for redesigning the ordering and inventory management methodologies for purchased parts in a manufacturing firm. The method takes the perspective of the purchasing and logistics manager, defines clusters of purchased items, and subsequently assigns each cluster to a suitable way of ordering and inventory management. An application of the method, resulting in an 11 percent overall supply costs reduction proposal, is presented. The application shows that the method is particularly suitable for a first, rough redesign of the existing - usually undifferentiated - way of ordering and managing inventory. In addition, the method may provide a clear format for collaboration among the various disciplines involved in the redesign process.

TI  - Implementing an Effective Inventory Management System
DO  - 10.1108/EUM0000000000376
PY  - 1990///
AB  - Inventory control problems often result in record and physical count discrepancies which may ultimately lead to higher than preferred inventory levels. Conversely, accurate inventory records result in lower inventory investment and are the foundation for forecasting, ordering, tracking, vendor evaluation, and dead stock administration programmes. Guidelines, based on general systems theory, to identify the presence of inventory control problems in both physical operations and information systems areas are presented. Next, procedures to correct control problems are discussed. These include the formation of a permanent taskforce, corporate‐wide education on the importance of record accuracy, and the development of a general management plan based on sound principles for effective inventory control. Recent experiences within a telecommunications company having inventory control problems are used as a case example to illustrate specific points.

TI  - Inventory Management and Its Effects on Customer Satisfaction
PY  - 2007///
AB  - This study examines inventory management and the role it plays in improving customer satisfaction. It looks at how food companies have been under pressure to streamline their inventory systems, and the consequences of such actions. It also examines how many retailers are trying to implement a “perfect order” system and how suppliers are constantly under pressure to meet the demands of these retailers. Many food companies are, therefore, looking at various inventory management systems as they belief this will have a positive effect on the satisfaction of their customers. The paper also outlines the methodology used in the research and concludes by pointing out the limitations of the research as well as suggestions for further research.

TI  - Inventory management in Sydney Public Hospital Blood Banks
DO  - 10.1111/j.1365-3148.1994.tb00278.x
PY  - 1994///
AB  - SUMMARY. Monitoring the outdating of donated units is one way of assessing the efficiency of blood usage. Inventory management in public hospital blood banks in Sydney was reviewed with the aim of determining factors which lead to the outdating of donor blood. Factors which correlated significantly with increased outdating in hospitals included absence of an effective hospital transfusion committee; high ratio of average inventory: units transfused; fewer than three routine deliveries from the BTS per day; increased time taken for delivery of urgent products; CT values greater than 2: 1; premature performance of the crossmatch and prolonged crossmatching holding time. Hospitals were informed of the initial audit results and were alerted to the factors contributing to excessive outdating. They received monthly feedback of individual outdating results compared with overall outdating. After 6 months there was a significant reduction in overall outdating from 5.0 to 0.9% (P < 0.05), which has been maintained for a further 12 months. Changes in inventory management associated with an improvement in overall outdating included: changes in crossmatching practice which increase the effective shelf‐life of blood, knowledge of when blood was due to outdate and effective stock rotation.

TI  - A Quality Control Approach for Monitoring Inventory Stock Levels
DO  - 10.1057/JORS.1993.184
PY  - 1993///
AB  - In this paper we develop a new approach to monitor the accuracy of an inventory management system. A recorded stock level is considered accurate when the recorded level agrees with the actual stock level, otherwise there is an error. In practice, management relies on methods to measure or assure inventory accuracy not necessarily developed for this purpose. Our methodology is based on the average absolute relative difference as a simple analytical measure for inventory accuracy (ACN). The approach captures the status of accuracy in an inventory and allows for greater understanding of what affects inaccuracy since the theoretical measure of accuracy is composed of several parameters representing the incidence and proportion of both overstock and understock. The implementation of the methodology is constrained because complete inspection of the inventory is very expensive in most situations, so we develop the sample analogue of the accuracy measure (ACn) and discuss sampling strategies. The accuracy of the inventory system is monitored by incorporating ACn into a univariate control chart.

TI  - TOWARD A THEORY OF WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
DO  - 10.1111/J.1540-6261.1955.TB01259.X
PY  - 1955///
AB  - THE FUNCTION OF ANY BUSINESS is to supply goods or services as required by the community. This can be restated as follows: raw materials are processed or services are channeled resulting in a product or service that is more valuable as measured by our price system than the original materials or the unchanneled services. In this productive process, labor is applied to raw materials which then become the finished inventory of the business. As sold, this is translated into receivables and ultimately into cash. The cash in turn is used to pay for raw materials, taxes, labor, plant, and equipment as well as to provide a return to the investors. Many individuals contribute to this repetitive and continuing process. In this paper I will discuss the role and function of that individual who is directly concerned with the management of the cash that has been generated by this productive process. This individual is the money manager of the firm. All of us remember our first economic texts that described money as the lubricant that "oiled the wheels of industry." As an "oiler" it is the task of the money manager to insure that his firm has sufficient funds to operate. In addition, he must provide adequate safeguards for those assets intrusted to his care and invest temporarily surplus funds as profitably as possible in view of his particular requirements of safety and liquidity. The money manager ordinarily functions in many areas of a company. His operations affect all of the working capital accounts. However, in such areas as the determination of inventory levels other persons within the finance function and in production operations are more directly concerned. The subject of the control of inventories, receivables, and payables is worthy of a separate paper and I will only touch briefly on them here. The net working capital of any corporation is the net current asset position or the excess of current assets over current liabilities. All cash, short-term investments,1 receivables, and inventories are

TI  - Knowledge-based inventory management in production logistics: A multi-agent approach
DO  - 10.1243/095440505X28990
PY  - 2005///
AB  - Abstract With the rapidly changing market conditions, an accurate and highly dynamic inventory management model is much needed for making an enterprise more predictable to the global competition. However, traditional inventory management in production logistics is inadequate in managing inventories with high fluctuation in demand and value. To establish effective inventory management strategy, this paper presents a knowledge-based inventory management system for active inventory replenishment based on multi-agent dynamic forecasting and knowledge-based system technologies. The system dynamically forecasts the fluctuation of the demand and updates price of its raw materials. Hence, appropriate inventory management strategies are derived to respond and adapt to the rapid market changes and the material requirement. A prototype system has been built and successfully trial implemented in a manufacturing enterprise.

In a study of the operations of a textile manufacturer, methods, were developed for determining based on sales data the duration and timing of the selling seasons, and for forecasting total sales for the season for each individual item in the line, at different probability levels. From these, criteria for weekly re-evaluation of inventories are established.

DO  - 10.1080/0020754031000121392
PY  - 2003///
AB  - Good inventory management is a mean to improve customer service and reduce stock. The book aims to provide an overview of best practice in inventory management. The author calls it a ‘driver’s manual for Inventory Controllers’. It is not written for university needs but for practitioners who want to understand the basic concepts of inventory control. Thus, the author does not include advanced or complex theoretical approaches. After a brief introduction, the author starts with the objectives of inventory management. He continues with arguing that the basic idea consists of the linkage of ABC analysis and stock cover. In this context, the concept of JIT is described to be the aim of best practice. Subsequently, the organizational needs for implementing a lean inventory management are specified. The author continues to present inventory management on the level of individual item control. This contains the stochastic element of demand and the resulting calculation of required safety stock and stock level as well as order quantities to achieve a predefined service level. Additionally, the supplier’s relations are characterized. Inventory management is useless without forecasting. The author briefly addresses few methods of forecasting and the issue of obtaining the right data. The book concludes with material requirement planning and future development of inventory and logistics. A section of exercises is also included. The book gives an overview of the subjects to be stressed in inventory management. For most part, the book is easy to read. Besides well-specified organizational decisions there exist for the practitioner two questions: when and how much to order or to produce. The author answers these questions implicitly by developing performance measures or by explaining parts of management tools. In fact, recommendations such as ‘order enough for one week for A-class-items’ may be correct for one company but cannot be seen as a general rule. The novice may have difficulties reproducing the equations the author presents. The examples given, for which solutions can be obtained manually, however may help. Inventory management is a very well structured topic in production/operations management. It is all the more disappointing that the author does not use this structure to lead those unfamiliar with inventory management through the book. None of the methods introduced are wrong but the material is – although well presented – poorly structured. The economic objective pursued is the reduction of inventory cost. This leads to the advice not to use the EOQ-formula because it produces high inventory. Excluding transportation cost or the cost for set-ups may not reduce the total cost. Despite the existing shortcomings of EOQ, it has been shown to produce significant results. In summary, the book may be used as a first introduction for practitioners but it should not be the only source for those who want to understand inventory management.

PY  - 1954///
AB  - In past decades there have been occasional upsurges of intensive interest in inventory control problems, sometimes in the aftermath of forced inventory liquidation. For the most part, the literature consisted of a few articles in business journals that had but little impact on the current business behavior of the time. In the last few years we have witnessed another upsurge of interest which far surpasses any of its predecessors, with respect to the quantity and quality of the work accomplished as well as its overall impact on the business community. This vigorous research and the interest it has aroused have been made possible by parallel development in research and in business. Statisticians and economists have become interested in industrial problems concomitantly with the increased attention in business to techniques of advanced management. The appearance of this journal is an example of this harmony of interests that has come into being. The fact that modern statistical methods have been applied successfully in several instances has had much influence on the interest level of both research workers and industrialists.

TI  - Inventory Management : Forecast Based Approach vs. Standard Approach
PY  - 2005///
AB  - In this paper, we provide a literature review on inventory management policies. Two approaches are distinguished : the standard inventory management approach and the advance demand information based approach. We focus on the advance demand information based approach. In particular, we study a pure single-stage and single-item inventory system where demand is given in the form of forecasts. Two forecast based inventory management policies are proposed, namely : the (rk,Q) which is a dynamic reorder point policy and the (T,Sk) which is a dynamic order-upto policy. These policies are compared to the standard (r,Q) and (T,S) policies. We also show that in certain cases the two forecast based inventory management policies and the standard inventory management policies are equivalent. Further, a new safety parameter, called safety quantity, is introduced and compared to the classical safety stock parameter. A practical approach is proposed to compute this safety quantity.

TI  - The development of an intelligent inventory management system
DO  - 10.1108/09576069910293022
PY  - 1999///
AB  - This thesis is concerned with the development of an intelligent inventory management system. The aim of the system is to bridge the substantial gap between the theory and the practice of inventory management and to help industrial inventory managers to achieve an effective and successful inventory management. The proposed system attempts to achieve this by providing automatic pattern identification and model selection facilities. Such a hybrid knowledge-based inventory system consists of a collection of techniques (or pattern identifier) for identifying demand and lead time patterns and a knowledge base (or rule base) for subsequent selection of a suitable inventory model taking into consideration aspects of the practical situation. There are no previous attempts in the inventory literature to develop such a system to guide model selection. In order to integrate the system into the established computer-based intelligent inventory management system and facilitate the function of the pattern identifier, a data manager has been developed to manipulate the history data required for statistical analysis and to load the data into the system from other applications. In order to establish the system's model base, the study of the modelling of inventory and the features and evolution of expert systems are reviewed. The published models which deal with similar inventory problems have been compared based on its applicability, clarity, and being suitable to be computerised. It was necessary to further develop and amend published models to fill gaps in the model base. The overall structure and salient features of the proposed system and the development of the system using Visual Basic have been described. The system has been tested using real life data supplied by the co-operating companies. Finally, achievements and shortcomings of the system are discussed and some suggestions for further research are outlined.

TI  - Inventory Management Techniques
PY  - 1985///
AB  - INVENTORY MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES Small businesses, both manufacturers and retailers, now have the opportunity to reduce inventory-related costs significantly through the use of various inventory techniques implemented on a micro- or mini-computer. Inventory techniques are divided into two categories--those for independent demand items (finished goods) and those for dependent demand items (manufacturing-in-process items and raw material). The use of micro-computers is growing rapidly, with material requirements planning (MRP) systems currently available for use on micro-and mini-computers. These MRP systems assist the small manufacturer in planning and controlling inventory levels of dependent demand items and in scheduling work centers (for example, see Cox and Clark).1 Several techniques offer potential for savings with independent demand items. Independent demand item techniques are subdivided into continuous review models, periodic review models, and mixed models. 1 James F. Cox and Steven J. Clark, "Material Requirements Planning System Development,' Computers and Industrial Engineering, vol. 2 (1978), pp. 123-139. The model most frequently presented is the continuous review model (reorder point/economic order quantity model). It is very easy to derive, hence it is extremely popular for classroom exercises and journal articles.2,3 However, an assumption implicit in continuous review models is that a perpetual inventory is maintained so that it is practical to release a replenishment order on the day the reorder point is reached. Thus, continuous review models assume that point-of-sale information is being collected. 2 W. E. Dollan, Purchasing Management and Inventory Control for Small Business, Small Business Management Series No. 41, U.S. Small Business Administration (1980). 3 E. Lin, "Inventory Control Systems for Small Business,' American Journal of Small Business (spring 1980), pp. 11-19. The continuous review technique, while very practical for a computerized inventory system collecting point-of-sale data, is not practical for manual systems handling numerous different items. Three other techniques are discussed in this article--the periodic review model, the mixed model, and the time-phased order point model. The continuous review model is presented first to give a point of reference. CONTINUOUS REVIEW MODEL There are dozens of variations of the continuous review inventory model.4 The version discussed here is derived from the following assumptions: 4 This article discusses only the simplest model. More complete discussions can be found in Rein Peterson and Edward A. Silver, Decision Systems for Inventory Management and Production Planning (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1979), and E. Naddor, Inventory Systems (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1966). The item under consideration is independent of all other items (no joint replenishment). Demand for the item varies (is random), but the average demand is constant over time. Lead time is known and constant. Holding costs and replenishment costs are known and constant. The inventory position is maintained at all times. Under these circumstances, a continuous review model calls for an order, of size Q, to be placed whenever the reorder point, s, is reached. The formulas for Q and s are as follows: Q = 2dr/h (1) s = D k v, (2) where d = annual demand for the item, r = replenishment cost per occurrence, h = holding cost per item per year, D = average demand during lead time, v = standard deviation of demand during lead time, and k = management determined variable. The formula for s includes an estimate of the demand during the item's lead time and safety stock to protect against stockout. …

AB  - Inventory management is an extremely important function to any business, since inadequacies in control can result in serious problems. If inventories are managed in an inefficient manner, it is likely that delays in production, dissatisfied customers, or curtailment of working capital will result.

AB  - A critical aspect of blood transfusion is the timely provision of high quality blood products. This task remains a significant challenge for many blood services and blood systems reflecting the difficulty of balancing the recruitment of sufficient donors, the optimal utilization of the donor's gift, the increasing safety related restrictions on blood donation, a growing menu of specialized blood products and an ever-growing imperative to increase the efficiency of blood product provision from a cost perspective. As our industry now faces questions about our standard practices including whether or not the age of blood has a negative impact on recipients, it is timely to take a look at our collective inventory management practices. This International Forum represents an effort to get a snap shot of inventory management practices around the world, and to understand the range of different products provided for patients. In addition to sharing current inventory management practices, this Forum is intended to foster an exchange of ideas around where we see our field moving with respect to various issues including specialty products, new technologies, and reducing recipient risk from blood transfusion products.

AB  - A market-demand-forecasting-value calculation section acquires order entry actual achievement data from an order-entry-actual-achievement-data storing unit of an order receiving system, and calculates a market demand forecasting value using the order entry actual achievement data. A correction safety inventory quantity calculation section calculates an error rate, which becomes negative when an ordering required-quantity becomes large, based on a number of ordered parts and a past ordering required-quantity. Subsequently, the correction safety inventory quantity calculation section calculates a correction safety inventory quantity using the error rate and the market demand forecasting value and a money-amount-zone index value. Further, the correction safety inventory quantity calculation section calculates a determined safety inventory quantity which is a value obtained by adding the correction safety inventory quantity and a reference safety inventory quantity calculated based on the market demand forecasting value.
